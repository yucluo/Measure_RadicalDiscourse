21786,2157,"America's response to the Soviet Union against Czechoslovakia is not rash and should not be rash, but it must be realistic and a realistic appraisal of the assumptions and the promises that underlie American policy toward the Soviet Union. A policy of realism toward the Soviet today will be a policy that is directed toward their prudence and not just toward their good will. That kind of policy holds the prospect of peace.",rep,1968,False,False,31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

It's a 15 percent across-the-board tax cut for families.

That's who John McCain is fighting for. But we can't afford four more years like the last eight. George Bush and John McCain are out of ideas, they are out of touch, and if you stand with me in 17 days they will be out of time.",dem,2008,False,False,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
9061,2646,"I do promise that in the next four years the national dignity will not be outraged by behavior which no president ought to tolerate in the White House. I do promise to renew the bond between the presidency and the people, forever conscious that the office of the president is a sacred trust. I do not couch my promises in high-sounding rhetoric.

29439,2204,"So, my friends, in this whole field of peace, I think it's a pretty clear question. It's a question of one man who is one of the architects and the supporters of a program of failure. No peace in four years, and it's a question of another man who lived through an administration in which we did have peace for eight years and ended one war.

We will rebuild our diplomatic corps so we don't send ambassadors and others out because they have contributed to a campaign, who can't even speak the language, who can't even pronounce the names of the heads of the countries, who have never been there, who want to stay there for a year while the communists stay there day after day, speaking the dialect, working subversion, attempting to win control of the country. There are four countries in Africa which are independent, which are members of the United Nations, and there is not an American diplomatic member of our Foreign Service in residence in any of the four.  When Guinea became independent it took us two months to recognize its independence.  It took us eight months to send an ambassador...[missing text]...was there the day they got independence, and Guinea now supports the communist foreign policy.",dem,1960,True,False,15,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The slogans for the Democratic party, on the other hand, have been the New Freedom, the New Deal, the Fair Deal, and Adlai Stevenson's New America. I come in 1960 talking about the new frontier. The new frontier is not the things that I am promising to do for you if I am elected president. The new frontier consists of the things that we are asking all of us to do for this country in the 1960s. This is a great country, but it deserves the best that we have. I suppose thirty or forty years ago, before the second administration of Woodrow Wilson, people who lived in this valley worried about their farms and their jobs, and now we worry about your farms and your jobs, but we worry about Cuba and the Congo and Indonesia, and the security of families, and the chances for peace. I ask your help in this campaign. I run for the office of the presidency not saying that if I am elected life will be easy, but I can promise you that I have a deep conviction, and I know that you share it, that we can do better than we are doing. If we can be stronger than we are, we can stand far more around the world than we do today. I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and I can tell you that twenty or twenty-five years ago, African leaders quoted Lincoln, Jefferson, and Franklin Roosevelt. They don't quote anybody in America today. They look at Peking and Moscow, and wonder which road they should take. I think we have to reestablish ourselves as a vital and vigorous society, concerned with the needs of our own people and holding out a helping hand to those around the world who look to us for friendship and assistance.","1475_1",0.065562747,FALSE,NA,"uncertainty",1,1,1

Some of those votes were very close, and always, of course, I sought support from all areas of our country, from businessmen, from people in organized labor and people in unorganized labor, working men and women, others throughout the country. Also, I have made some very hard decisions in the conduct of foreign policy. One of the hardest was the one I made on May 8th, when a massive Communist invasion took place in South Vietnam, where the Communists moved into the South, and where, in order to protect the 50,000 Americans that were there and in order to prevent the Communist imposition of a government on the people of South Vietnam, I ordered the mining of the harbors of Haiphong and the bombing of military targets in North Vietnam.","2319_7",0.999505119,FALSE,FALSE,"random",0,0,1

When Stalin died, John Foster Dulles said, """"The age of Stalin is over, and the age of Eisenhower begins.""""  I am not wholly convinced that that will be the verdict of history over the last seven or eight years.  I believe that this has been an entirely new period.  Just as when you stand by the ocean you cannot see the tide come in or go out, but if you leave it for a few hours, you can see which way it is moving, so historians for the perspective of 1970 and 1980 may draw a different conclusion about the last 8 years.  How much imprint have we left on our times?  If you read the debates of the United Nations, if you read the position that the new nations of the world are taking in those discussions, you realize that the relative power and influence of the United States is not increasing, as Mr. Nixon suggests; all is not well in the world.  We move with danger every day, and I believe the choice for the American people is between a party which believes that all is well and a party which rings the alarm bell.  I believe this is a time of danger.  I do not believe we can drift as usual.  I don't believe we can waste our natural resources.  I do not believe we can continue agricultural policies which drive down farm income.  I do not believe we can use our steel production, the great source of natural wealth, 50 percent of capacity.  I am not pleased to see countries around the world, when asked who will be first, say the Soviet Union in outer space, in science, in military power, in the next ten years.  I am not satisfied to have the balance of power begin to shift against us.  That is the alternative that the people of this community must face.  That is the prospect and that is the decision.  Do you wish to continue that leadership which has not only brought us to our present peril but which also does not recognize the peril?  Mr. Nixon accuses me of downgrading the United States.  I make no criticism as serious and severe as Governor Rockefeller made last June, or as General Ridgway has made before he began to graze contently in Richard Nixon's pasture.  His indictments were far greater than mine, and the indictments of fact are more serious than any statement I could make.  This is not a partisan issue.  All Americans share a common devotion to their country.  What I downgrade is our leadership and its prospects for the future.  I come here to this community where the land has been good to the people and where I hope a new administration will be fair to the land, where the tobacco program which has served us well and which has been carried on by a Democratic Congress I hope can be carried into other agricultural commodities, so that supply and demand will protect the interests of the farmer.

And it is a tragic irony that even while these policies of failure here were being pursued our policy-makers received repeated and urgent warnings that international communism was becoming a moving force behind Mr. Castro and the revolution--that our interest and the interests of freedom were in danger--that a new Soviet satellite was in the making. Our Ambassador to Cuba in the early days of the revolution--Arthur Gardner--repeatedly warned the administration that communism was a moving force in the Castro leadership.  Testifying recently before a Senate committee, he was asked if he had not reported """"that Castro talked and acted like a Communist and should not be supported by the United States.""""

0.635298622,0.364701378,"CARTER. In the first place, we have to remember that unemployment and inflation go hand-in-hand. I think if you will remember back historically when Truman went out of office, the unemployment rate was under 3 percent and the inflation rate was below 1 percent. The budget was balanced. When the Kennedy and Johnson administration was over and Richard Nixon came into office, he had a balanced budget; the unemployment rate was under 4 percent I think the average inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent. Under this administration we have had extremely high unemployment--it is now 7.9 percent--at least twice that among minority groups--sometimes as much as five times that in young minority groups. At the same time, we have had unprecedented inflation. We haven't had this high inflation rate since the War Between the States. We have not had this high of a deficit in the history of our country. Those things go together. I would address this as a combination because they go hand-in-hand. One is to restore the integrity of some of the federal programs--like housing; we have about 20 percent unemployment rate in the construction industry. Nixon impounded the housing funds that had been set up under the Democratic Administration. Ford has never restored the strength of the housing program. I remember when FHA was a notable and successful federal entity. Last year, it lost $600 million. HUD, which is Housing and Urban Development Department, has had 500 indictments and 200 convictions and it has now become the world's greatest slum landlord. Here effective housing programs, unemployment in housing and construction industry go hand in hand. Another very important point is this. We need to orient the services of federal programs that are on the books as the Congress originally intended for the people who need them the most. When you have programs involving pollution control, health care, education, recreation, transportation, law enforcement, the Congress intended for those monies to go to people who needed them the most. But because of the Republican administration and because of the good campaign or political organization of more influential people--because they have more influence and are more articulate--those monies that ought to be going to the ghetto areas of downtown cities or the devastated families in isolated rural communities--have been going into the more affluent parts of our country and also into the more affluent suburban areas who needed the help least.

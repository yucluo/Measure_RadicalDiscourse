I don't believe anybody who has been bogged down in Washington twenty-five or thirty years is going to make a change that's basic. When I was elected governor, we did it. We had 300 agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions; we eliminated 278 of them. We cut them down to a manageable level. We opened up government so people could understand it and control it. As Briscoe pointed out, we instituted zero budgeting, and I'll do it as soon as I get to the White House--strip down the government and start from scratch. We will eliminate unnecessary programs, detect overlapping and duplication, and set priorities for our nation that meet our need next year, and not what was needed fifty years ago. We need to decrease the influence of lobbyists and special interest groups. We must maintain sustained growth. God's blessed us in this country with rich farmland and mineral resources, manufacturing capabilities, and our religious ethic to work. We believe in the Ten Commandments. One of them says that, """"Six days shalt thou labor and the other day you should honor the Lord's day."""" But most Americans remember the six days part as well. This resource that we have, needs to be adequately tapped. We've seen under this Republican administration the first balance-of-trade deficit since the Great Depression, I think in 100 years, since the War Between the States. That's not a characteristic of our country. We need an aggressive sale of American products overseas, we need to put an end to the constant Republican farm embargoes, and we need to put someone in charge of the Agriculture Department that understands that what is best for the family farmer in the long run is exactly what's best for the consumer.",2375_8,0.999938404,FALSE,FALSE,random,0,0,

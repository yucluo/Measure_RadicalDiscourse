Life is a constant struggle between good and evil, but what is most enduring in the American character are these ideals with which we began. They are based on the Judeo-Christian ethics. No one can read the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and the Bill of Rights without realizing that those national ideals come out of the great religious traditions of this country and of Western civilization behind it, so that while it is true we have frequently departed from those ideals--and that happens every time somebody is mugged on the street or hit over the head in an apartment hall--nevertheless that stands in violation to the ideals of the country.

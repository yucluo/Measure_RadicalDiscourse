237,237,2215,4,"And what about those athletes who will never run a race, or lift a weight, or ever smile again? Let us at least draw some meaning that is lasting from their martyrdom. As I said here in Los Angeles last night to a large rally in the streets--I have no careful solutions to offer, and nothing that is strikingly new to say. What needs to be said once more all around the world is """"Let us stop the killing and stop the killing everywhere."""" Let us stop it here in our own land before we convince our own children that violence is in fact the normal way of life. Let us stop it while we still have the capacity to love one another as human beings--not just the few people right in our neighborhood, our own families and those around us--but people everywhere who, like us, want their years of happiness and life. But if I have anything to say about the course of events in the years ahead, there is one thing, above all else, that I would like to say and do. I would like to make it possible for a child in the Middle East, or anywhere else around this world, to live a full and secure and happy life before that child dies. I want to try to make it possible for that little girl in Vietnam that we saw running into the arms of the camera lens on fire from Napalm to be blessed by the warmth of love rather than the tragedy of war. I want to try and make it possible for people to live as though we really were created in the image of God rather than in the image of our worst fears and suspicions of each other. So I say """"Peace""""--not just now, but peace always. I say """"Peace""""--not just in one land, but in every land where there are men and women and children who don't know what it is to see a sunrise or to see trees in the springtime. I see and say """"Peace""""--on a planet which gives us life, among people who have no right to take it away from others. And I ask, as I did last night, that you say with me, in the words of that great prayer of St. Francis of Assisi, """"Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love."""" And then we will reap all of the blessings that we, and the generations before us, had hoped for, and our children will bless us because we have given them the fullness of life. That is what I most want for the people of the United States, the people of the Middle East, the people of Southeast Asia and for people who inhabit this planet all around the globe.",dem,1972,FALSE,not populist,randomly,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I found all over America--and it was reported by the news media, I think, with great enthusiasm because it showed a change--America was healed, America was on the move, and we all look forward to a great opportunity to do the things in the next four and the next 100 years that must be done to make that vision of our forefathers a reality. So, I thank Edith. She has taken on the leadership with two others, George Feldman and Dom DiMaggio, to get all the Independents and Democrats who feel, as I do, that this country does have an opportunity to do those wonderful things that our forefathers gave us the opportunity to do.

In other words, if you want to have a border, you want to have a wall, which creates a country. Even if you want people to come in, but come in through a legal process, she considers that un-American. So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers in the case of the Bernie Sanders people. She said they were basement dwellers. Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East, meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.",neither,1/27/21 2:01,inclusive,0,Seems pretty exclusionary--for immigration control and a wall

I want to say a few words directly to those citizens in this country who share the goals that I've just described to you, but who are considering a vote tomorrow for Congressman John Anderson. Obviously, there are some differences between us. But on many of the key issues of this campaign, like the need for energy conservation, pure air, clean water, controlling the spread of nuclear weapons, keeping our nation at peace, the equal rights amendment, our views are very close. And the most overriding issue of all, the issue of peace and the control of nuclear weapons and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to terrorist countries and to other nations that don't now have the atom bomb--on this great fundamental issue, all of the candidates are on one side except that Governor Reagan is on the other side.

In one Midwestern state in 1949 and again in 1951 it was the Republican legislators who killed the state FEPC bill that the governor worked hard to get.

You remember the recent Paris Conference in Paris--the conference in which Mr. Khrushchev broke it up, he said, on the grounds that President Eisenhower had ordered flights over Russian territory for the purpose of getting information with regard to their war preparations.  And after that conference, President Eisenhower was criticized by some on the ground that he didn't do as much as he could to save it, that maybe he might have saved the conference so that we could go ahead and talk with Mr. Khrushchev by expressing regrets or apologizing for those flights.  And my answer is: the President couldn't have done that for two reasons.  One: when you're dealing with a man like Mr. Khrushchev, you're not dealing with a man like leaders of the free world.  He doesn't react, you see, like Mr. Eisenhower; he doesn't react like Mr. Macmillan or President De Gaulle or Chancellor Adenauer.  This man is one who respects power; he is one who if you give him a concession without getting one in return, only asks for more.  And, therefore, expressing regrets would have been exactly the wrong thing to do; it would have encouraged him to be more demanding than he was before.  And the other reason the President was right in following the course he did was this: that no president of the United States must ever express regrets for doing what is right--attempting to defend the security of the United States.",rep,1960,False,False,19,1766_19,253

I said a moment ago that there is no way that we can separate the quality of our society here at home from the impact that we have on the world around us. So I think we must resume building a society in which government helps to bring people together, not to drive them apart; where it helps to increase opportunity for all of our people, not to limit that opportunity; and where it has the deepest roots of the American spirit and what is good and decent and enduring in the American character. I believe that we can have that kind of America again: a first-rate nation at home and abroad, where American greatness and commitment to international cooperation will again become a thing of admiration and wonder to the people of the world. Few other countries have faced what we have come through in recent years, but I reaffirm my belief here this afternoon that we can now be prepared to use what we have learned from this bitter past. We can learn from success and from failure to meet our responsibilities both at home and around us, and we can do that to the lasting benefit of our people and of our fellow mortals elsewhere in the world. In the final analysis, our foreign policy is no more than who and what we are as a free people.  It is a reflection of our attitudes towards ourselves. It is a reflection of the kind of values that we think are important about the conditions of man. It is a reflection of what we believe to be most enduring and most worthwhile in our own heritage. How we live in the neighborhoods and communities of America will determine how we live with our international neighbors and in the broader world community. This is a challenge that is appropriate to our ideals and to all that we have dared and won in nearly 200 years of our independence. As Abraham Lincoln, perhaps our greatest president, once said in a very dark hour for America: """"We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope on earth. I have faith that we shall nobly save that last best hope on earth.""""",dem,1972,True,False,17,2280_17,429

7172,7173,7172,2280,"SENATOR MCGOVERN: I would like to see us establish a system of wage and price controls that center on the heavily concentrated industries that have the most market power. I think it is impossible, except perhaps in the middle of a great and popular war where the spirit of patriotism and fervor is very high, to make wage and price controls work across the board. But I do believe that certain guidelines could be established for major industries. I would prefer that they function on a voluntary basis, but with the president of the United States using the power and influence of that office as President Kennedy did, and as was President Johnson able to do at least in the first couple of years of his administration, to see to it that those guidelines were followed, even when it becomes necessary for the president to go to the American people and turn the spotlight on some recalcitrant offender who has violated the guidelines. I would also advocate standby authority, which the president could use on the recommendation of a wage-price review board to turn back unjustified wage and price increases by Executive Order in those cases where the Board has found that the guidelines had been violated. I think the trouble with the present system is that it is such a scatter-shot comprehensive effort to reach everything that it reaches nothing. Ninety percent of the price increases that have been requested have gone through. What we ought to do is target in on those areas that really have market power, the major basic industries, and to concentrate on guidelines in those industries both on wages and prices--and I think it would work pretty well. It seemed to me that President Nixon made a great mistake in early 1969 when he scoffed at the notion of wage-price guidelines and in effect invited both industry and labor to go for the sky on wage-price increases. By the time he had recognized the error of his ways, inflation had virtually gotten out of control to the point where the wage-price controls that were brought in have been in trouble ever since. I have always thought that the principal trigger to the inflation that has plagued us for the last six or seven years is the war in Vietnam. And by ending that war and curtailing some of our military excesses, I think we could contribute much to reducing some of the inflationary pressures, to say nothing of the economic distortions that now afflict our economy.",dem,1972,False,True,19,2280_19,422

MCGOVERN: I think we have always been at war with ourselves. Life is a constant struggle between good and evil, but what is most enduring in the American character are these ideals with which we began. They are based on the Judeo-Christian ethics. No one can read the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and the Bill of Rights without realizing that those national ideals come out of the great religious traditions of this country and of Western civilization behind it, so that while it is true we have frequently departed from those ideals--and that happens every time somebody is mugged on the street or hit over the head in an apartment hall--nevertheless that stands in violation to the ideals of the country. And I think nowhere have we so stubbornly and so blindly violated those ideals as we have in Southeast Asia. The tragic thing about our whole experience in Southeast Asia since the end of World War II is that for the most part, we have been on the side of the forces for independence and against imperialism. We encouraged the Dutch to get out, the British to get out, French to withdraw from some of their holdings, but then somehow we have moved into the same trap ourselves in an effort to order other people's lives. And I think everything we are doing now in Southeast Asia, no matter how it is disguised, is a direct violation of what most Americans regard as the enduring ideals of this country.",dem,1972,True,False,20,2280_20,288

Let me first of all tell you what kind of defense I think we ought to have because I think that when we start talking about defense cuts before we talk about what kind of defense we need, I think we're putting the cart before the horse. And I have a general opposition to what I perceive to be the two major approaches to reducing the defense budget which we have seen in the last four years. One is what might be called the predominant--not exclusively but the predominant administration approach--which is basically to downsize the defense structure we have more or less across the board, except taking more out of the Guard and Reserves than the main force. But otherwise, just make what we have smaller. The other might be called the piggyback approach that some people in my party have taken, which is, the Cold War's over, let's just see how much money we can get out of the defense budget to do other things. The proper question is, what are the security threats to the United States?

I know there's a big dispute about this. But let me say that France has stopped testing; Russia has stopped testing.

But that top-secret document brought out one fact that really answers your question. It was this. There was a military estimate made in September 1947 by military men, and it had this conclusion: The military occupation of South Korea is not essential to the military security of the United States of America.",rep,1952,False,False,38,1300_38,92

A: A little thing along with that, Mr. Nagel, you might consider also. I have stated several times that the Republic of Korea coveted and deserved the honor of defending its own front lines so far as it was able to do so. There have been serving in Korea during these past years--and you know I have been in Europe for a year--there have been serving men of great distinction who are old, old friends of mine, and from them I have had many reports about the South Koreans. Their reports on the military qualifications and capabilities of the South Korean soldiers are glowing--glowing no less. They give specific instances of their great heroism, courage and stamina. And they have said, """"Had these programs of training, organizing and equipping these men been pursued assiduously from the very first moment we got in that war, we would be in a position now that our casualties wouldn't have to be so heavy."""" I believe that and I believe we should push those programs just as fast as we can right now, because everybody admits there is no simple, easy patent medicine answer to the Korean situation. So what must we do? Get partial answers that improve our situation every minute. And when we get to the point that we are not having to provide the great bulk of the men, as well as the great bulk of the munitions and all of the rest of the costs out there, then the other side will have a little different look at this problem.

I believe President Rhee said at one time that they could furnish a total out of their 20 million population of at least 3 million soldiers. Another thing: The Korean Ambassador to the United States, in making a speech and pleading for the right of the Koreans as a proud people to defend their own front lines said, """"Give us guns, save your sons.""""

When we get the outstanding men of the United States, men and women, from every section and from every walk of life, men and women who are incorruptible themselves, they are not going to appoint to important positions people who are corruptible. That is the first thing. But if they do find one of these people who has erred and has gone the wrong way and is disloyal to America, they will be very, very tireless in searching them out, digging them out. It is my contention there is plenty of power in the American government to do this. We have got the FBI and all sorts of investigative facilities, and if there is the will we can do this and never violate one single iota of the American doctrine that every man is innocent until he is proved guilty.

I've given interviews to people that would probably be better for me not to talk to. But Playboy has a wide readership, and I think it's good for their readers to know about me. The editors particularly wanted to know about my Christian beliefs. And I think that's a group of Americans who may not hear enough about Christianity and moral and ethical beliefs, from myself and any other source. So I decided to answer the questions. The basic question that was so controversial, and I wish all of you would read the entire article--I think you would say that it was a good interview--but the particular thing that had so much publicity was when the question was asked, """"As a Baptist, as a Christian, do you condemn other people who don't share your religious faith?"""" And I said that my religious beliefs are that we are not in a position of condemning others. That we are not supposed to say I'm not very guilty, another person is very guilty, therefore I condemn another person. God says, """"Judge not that ye be not judged."""" And I made the point that as president, I would certainly not condemn those who were different from me, but I would try to work to end the afflictions on our society. That would be my legal responsibility. And I also made the point that Baptists, perhaps as strong as any other denomination, believe in complete separation of church and state. But the one example that I used was about adultery. And it was possibly not a very fortunate choice, but as you know at the Sermon on the Mount, it said that if you even look with lust on a woman you have in your own heart committed adultery, therefore, don't condemn people who may have done even worse. And that was the illustration that I used. And it perhaps was an unfortunate illustration. But I don't have any apology to make for it. I thought it was a good way to let the American people, particularly Playboy readers, know about my religious beliefs. I think it was perhaps typical of my campaign. I might say this.

One kind of reform, in fact the only one that comes to my mind right now, is the person who uses tax shelters, where the income is actually excluded from taxation by a legal, legally authorized trick.

About half of it goes to property tax credits, about half of it goes for interest payment credits. That amount would be retained. If any change was made it would be to shift the credit toward the low- and middle-income families who are buying their first homes. The amount, though, I think is adequate. I wouldn't reduce it. I promised not to do that. For those who are buying a second or third home, that benefit may be decreased, because I think it's best to have the major incentive for building homes go to those who are buying their first home and who need the money most.

In South Korea, I think we ought to withdraw all of our atomic weapons. We now have in excess of 600 there. They're quite vulnerable, if there was a drastic military operation in South Korea. I don't foresee the possibility that we would use them in a localized war that might erupt in South Korea. I certainly hope it won't and don't expect it to. I talked about this to several people who are, perhaps, certainly more knowledgeable than I, including former Secretary James Schlesinger. He agrees with that position. I don't believe that the withdrawal of atomic weapons from South Korea would encourage Japan to become a nuclear power. And I think that the Japanese people are absolutely committed against that and the Japanese government has not yet signed the nonproliferation treaty. But I think they could be induced to do so if we took actions that I described in my nonproliferation talk. I also favor the withdrawal of our ground troops from South Korea. I might add, without speaking for him that Mr. Schlesinger agrees with this position as well as so does the President of South Korea, Mr. Park. This would be done over a period of four or five years.

26916,26917,26916,2038,"QUESTION:  Mr. Vice President, would you give some of your views and plans for the expansion of vocational education after you take office? VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  Yes, sir.  I hope that you are a vocational teacher or involved in it.  I was once in charge of a good deal of vocational education in my home state of Minnesota and I am very interested in it.  I think much of the present education is not very relevant to the needs of the young man or the woman that gets it.  I don't want to be misunderstood.  We need a liberal amount of humanities and social sciences.  But we need to train people to live and train people to work.  Once vocational education was looked upon as the inferior education.  Today, technical and vocational education ought to be looked upon as the living education, as a part of relevant education, education relevant to our society.  It needs to be expanded and improved and it needs to have a much greater tie-in with industry.  You should not be having vocational education just for vocational education.  The program should be tied right on in with your local and industrial groups so that there is a kind of advisory board or some sort of mechanism that designs that vocational education is relevant to the industrial needs of this day and age and the time to come.  It is beginning to be that way now in some places.  This also includes manpower training and development that goes beyond the high school age.  We must remember that everybody is not going to go to college, even though 54 percent of the families today do have a son or daughter in college.  We must remember that it is not always necessary for a person to go to college and get a professional education.  He can go to an institute, a technical institute, to come from high school into a kind of community college experience that has a great deal of vocational type of educational experience.  That educational experience should be in the classroom and on the job.  It must be a mixture of it and they ought to get as much credit for the kind of experience that they have on the job as they get in the classroom and they should be graded on both.  That is my view of it. ",dem,1968,True,False,80,2038_80,394

It is my understanding from what I have read and what the government has provided me in information that we did not violate the territorial waters of North Korea; in other words, that we were within our international rights.

ANSWER: I have been thinking about that last night and all of this morning, and it occurred to me that one thing that the United States might take the lead in would be to press before the United Nations Secretariat a proposal that plans be developed to more carefully monitor and to neutralize the activities of this terrorist gang. This is a threat to every human being and particularly those who travel in any part of the world. It cuts across all religious grounds, all international boundaries, and it is, in fact, a responsibility of the international community. And I think that some kind of surveillance and monitoring and counteraction is going to have to be developed, hopefully under the auspices of the United Nations, to deal with this problem.

32873,32874,32873,2215,"Q: I believe that as long as Israel is strong militarily and Arab nations are weak that there will be peace in the Middle East. Would you concur with this thinking? A: Yes, I think that this is the principal ingredient that has not only preserved the survival of Israel but has, for most of the time during the last twenty years, dealt with the temptation that the Arabs always had to attack in a moment of weakness. So I think it is important that Israel maintain its strength and that the United States do what is necessary to assist in that effort. I think it is fair to say that Israel has the most committed and most effective fighting force that has ever been assembled, man for man, anywhere in the modern world--and woman for woman, in the case of Israel. And what our role is as a country is to see that the equipment that Israel needs to survive is supplied and supplied promptly. One of the reasons that I so resent some of the criticisms that have been directed at me on a partisan basis about my support for Israel is that, ever since I first came to the Congress in 1957, I have always been on the side of those Congressmen who were pressing the administration--no matter which administration it was, but including this one--to move more quickly in meeting the requests for planes and military equipment that Israel needs to survive. The first significant roll call that I answered, as a brand new member of Congress way back in 1957 when I was in the House of Representatives, was to vote against the so-called Eisenhower Doctrine in the Middle East, which in more concrete terms was a proposal to provide $200 million in military aid to the Arab states. I voted against it and the Congressional Record will show that I took the floor to warn that military equipment of that kind would be used, not to defeat Communism in the Middle East, but would more likely be used in an attempt to destroy the State of Israel. And I was right in that prediction and I think that the votes I have cast in the Congress over the years are clearly on the side of providing strong support for the survival and independence of Israel.",dem,1972,True,False,6,2215_6,391

It really singles out one of the most depressed groups in our country, and one of the most vulnerable groups, for special restrictions that deny them the opportunity to improve working conditions and to improve standards of life for their families. It is a discriminatory proposal, in that it denies to those who work with their hands on the land the same kind of organizing and collective bargaining rights--the same kind of instruments that other working people have to advance their conditions--and on that ground alone I would oppose it.

A: I don't have an easy answer to that and I am not optimistic about an early solution of the struggles and the tensions in the Middle East. Those problems run very deep and I do not envision a quick and early resolution of the problem. I can only say this: that I see no other workable alternative other than direct negotiations involving the Arab governments and the State of Israel. That may take some time and I think it would be a mistake for the United States or any outside power to try to predetermine the results of those negotiations. Our only function can be to continue to press all parties to sit down at the conference table and negotiate out these differences on a face to face basis. There will doubtless have to be some concessions on both sides, but no concessions will last that deny Israel the right to defensible borders and that involve commitments that they feel jeopardize their security.

32877,32878,32877,2215,"Q: With respect to proposed reduction in our armed forces--specifically with respect to the Mediterranean and your proposals--how would this affect Israel? Would you comment on that? A: Yes. What I have proposed is a phased reduction in military spending over the next three years, hopefully to achieve reductions at the rate of about $10 billion a year in a budget that will otherwise by 1975 reach close to $90 billion. The Brookings Institute recommends that by 1977--an estimate--it would go beyond $100 billion. I think we all know that there are areas in the military budget of enormous waste and anybody who has ever been in military service knows that to be a fact. It isn't that it is intentional; it is just that it is part of the nature of the animal. There is waste built in, and I suppose some $75 to $80 billion have been thrown away on weapons systems in the last ten years that proved to be boondoggles that we abandoned after a period of time. Maybe a little more careful scrutiny might have avoided that waste. What I have proposed is that we look a little more carefully at what are the actual defense needs of our own country and the needs of our allies, including Israel, including our historic allies in Europe and elsewhere around the world. And that we construct a military budget not on the basis of what we have always said we needed, but on the basis of what actual conditions in the world, so far as we can forecast, would dictate. And the alternative budget that I have proposed would still leave the mightiest aggregation of sea and air power in the Mediterranean ever assembled in the history of the world. We would still have an aircraft carrier task force in the Mediterranean. Another standing by that could be moved in very quickly. We would increase, under my budget, our submarine capacity in the Mediterranean and in other parts of the world to offset the increasing Soviet ship surfacing capability and that is the proper way to respond to increase Soviet surface ships. That is to beef up our own submarine fleet. I suspect that we are moving towards the day when the submarine will become the flagship of the American fleet. But we do, under the alternative budget that I proposed, which has been endorsed by some of the most thoughtful military experts in the country, retain both the conventional capability and the nuclear capability of responding to any reasonable threat we can anticipate. We could, for example, with the military budget that I have suggested, destroy every significant target in the Soviet Union and China simultaneously and we could destroy those targets at least twenty times over. I don't know why you have to kill anybody twenty times, but it would have that capacity if necessary--that kind of built-in overkill capability. I do call for reducing the number of forces in Western Europe from four-and-one-third divisions to two divisions. But as you know, we have a very effective airlift in this country and if it were necessary to move forces back in, we could do that very quickly and our enemies and friends know that.

With a change in administration, would this alter that plan in any way? A: Yes, it would. I don't think that prediction is too far wide of the mark. There were reports some weeks ago, if my memory is right, quoting two high ranking Egyptian diplomats, who said they had been told by Secretary Rogers that with the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Egypt, that after the election we would review our commitments in the Middle East and press harder on the Israeli government to accept an adjusted settlement of some kind. It has always seemed to me that the clearest difference between my commitment to Israel and the commitment of the Nixon administration is that I am committed to the State of Israel because I believe in the humane values and the concept of freedom and dignity that Israel represents. I would be for the State of Israel if the Soviet Union didn't exist. On the other hand, I think, and I don't want to be unfair to the Nixon administration because they have done some very worthwhile things in the Middle East, but I do think, in all fairness, that their chief motivation has been Cold War power politics, in which their commitment to the State of Israel really stems from the Administration's fear of what the Soviet Union is up to in the Middle East. And once that threat appears to subside somewhat, I will predict that the commitment of this administration to the State of Israel will subside and once again Israel will likely be thrown up against military and political and terroristic pressures from her surrounding Arab neighbors, without the kind of response from the Nixon administration that you get when you think they are dealing with Russia rather than with the Arab threat in the Middle East.

32882,32883,32882,2215,"Q: What about the quota percentage for the Jewish community? A: I don't believe in percentage quotas. I do believe in the kind of effort we made at the Democratic National Convention this year to arrive at representation for various groups on a basis that was more in proportion to their percentage of the population than we have done in the past. I think it was all to the good that we set forth guidelines that increased the number of women participating in the Democratic Convention. In 1968, only 13% of the delegates were women. And we said that with regard to women, and on grounds of sex, on grounds of age, and on grounds of race, that the delegations from the various states should bear some relationship, not a percentage quota, but some reasonable relationship of their proportion to the total population. Now that means that nobody is going to stand up and holler if it turns out that there is a 40-60 split between men and women. It means that nobody is going to stand up and holler if the black people have 8% or 12%, but there is something wrong when they only have 5%, which is what the situation was in 1968. Now I think with reference to the government service or entrance to other institutions that you have a different set of factors operating--a national conference must in fact be represented by all the people of the country. In terms of government service, the merit factor must play a stronger role. I would think that this ought to be the first criteria in deciding who is going to be hired for a job. Who can best serve the country. And the other principle that we have to take into consideration is the one which is raised by a quota system. And I would do that not by going to a quota system, but by stepping up the efforts to recruit and inspire more participation in the government on the part of those groups that have been passed by--and this means more women, more black people, more Spanish-Americans, more Indians, additional appointments to well-qualified people--but in all cases the merit factor must be kept at the top of the list.",dem,1972,True,False,15,2215_15,374

DAVID GOSS:  Mr. Vice President, the theme of the 1968 National Democratic Convention was, """"promises made, promises kept.""""  I would like to have a comment on that phase, in light of two 1964 promises, those of peace and prosperity.  Then, President Johnson declared in that campaign, and I quote, """"No American boys will ever take over the major fighting and war which should be fought by agents.  Also, the 1964 Democratic platform proclaimed, """"we will seek further tax reduction, our goal is a balanced budget and our enviable record of price stability must be maintained.""""  Four years later, half a million American boys have taken over Asian burdens and we find both budget ceilings and taxes higher.  The income tax surcharge in response to galloping inflation.  My question, then, Mr. Vice President, is, how do you justify these promises of peace and prosperity that were, apparently, never kept?",dem,1968,True,False,26,2016_26,160
33305,33306,33305,2016,"VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  Well, let me take them in order.  First, on the prosperity side, we had ninety months consecutive economic growth.  The net income for families adjusted for price increases adjusted for taxes is 32 percent and eight years of 32 percent increase under the Kennedy-Johnson, Johnson-Humphrey period, as compared to the Nixon Republican Eisenhower period, they had 9 percent.  They had an increase of unemployment of two million.  We have the lowest unemployment rate that this country has had in twenty-five years.  Our gross national product is approximately eight hundred and eighty billion dollars.  There were three recessions under the Republican administration of '53 to '61, that cost this country, approximately, one hundred and seventy-five billion dollars in lost income.  The wholesale index for 1953 to 1961 has gone up--was almost identical in its increase as from 1961 to 1968.  The wholesale price index went up 9.2 and it's gone up to 9.3 in the last eight years, despite the war in Vietnam.  Taxes were reduced three times.  Had the same tax rate been in effect in 1968 that was in effect in 1964, we would have had a balanced budget with a substantial surplus.  The surtax is a very modest increase in taxes--very, very modest--a temporary one of one year--and even with that surtax, we have far lower federal taxes today, than we had four years ago.  So, on that side, I think we have a very good record--an extraordinarily good record.",dem,1968,False,False,27,2016_27,245

MR. VICE PRESIDENT:  I think by my record of public service--my record of public service.  Why I said those things are quite evident.  For example, when a man says the most important thing is to double the rate of convictions--but any rate--he condemns the President and myself, too.  That man has lost his sense of values.  You're not going to make this a better America, just because you build more jails.  What this community needs is more education, better homes.

VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY: I figured somebody might ask me that.  Would you have been able to stand on that?  What's in the majority plank represents what I have been trying to say to this country for a long, long time.  I think that the minority plank waffles the issue.  It isn't nearly as precise as some people think.  While it calls for unconditional ending for bombing, it doesn't say when; it doesn't say immediately, although the war in Vietnam is complex--that is an understatement.  Unconditional first, and unconditional ends all bombing of North Vietnam.  I don't know when they expect it; it doesn't say when.

And I, also, believe you should give a student some choice as to whether he wants to accept, when his number comes up, or go on for the first two years of his college.  I have a full paper with the general view--I thought that Congress should have adopted most of those provisions.  I intend to see, to the best of my ability as president, that the selective service boards in this country are truly representative of this country, that no one feels, because of race or economic status, that the board is not fully representative.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION FROM THE FLOOR: Q. You count on the demonstrations, I suppose?",dem,1968,True,False,38,2016_38,93
33318,33319,33318,2016,"Q. Do the demonstrations by students on particular issues, influence you in any way? A. Yes.  Let me kind of level with you.  You, know, demonstrations are not unique to this generation.  I participated in a few out at the University of Minnesota.  There hasn't been anything you students have tried to do that I haven't had a whack at myself, I think.  Let me say that one of the most heartening things happening in this country is when the young people in this campaign decide to take up and do something about racial disorders.  I think those freedom rides were immensely helpful.  I know, in 1963, the March on Washington with the late Martin Luther King--that the presence and the demonstrations of young people had a very decided affect upon many people.  Of course, that was a demonstration in which there were young and old, Catholic, Protestant, Jew, black and white.  I am sure that the dialogue which had been set up by young people has had a decided interest to the world.  If you think there is any moderation in it, at all, it is due in some measure to the activity of the young people and also to the leadership of men like Senator McCarthy and Senator McGovern, and possibly, myself--and may I say that I can add--maybe, the sympathetic understanding of the members of the administration that stands before you.  I have never been very interested in wars.  I have tried to spend a lifetime in works of peace.  I have had a little difficulty in getting that message out to some young people, but it is my life.  Peaceful demonstrations, where you give the other fellow a chance to be heard--you know, the right to be heard doesn't mean that you have the right to be taken seriously, but you ought to be heard.  And I think you have given me that chance today, and I want to say, too, that those that come here, that disagree with me, I think that you have treated me, maybe, a little better than I deserve--but don't change.

33319,33320,33319,2016,"Q. Mr. Humphrey, you said that you're against violence and brutality.  Why, therefore, didn't you speak out and use your influence in Chicago? A. I was the first man to ask the Bureau of Investigation to check and investigate, number one.  Secondly, I think that the facts are pretty clear now and if you want to really study the facts:  that there is so much blame on both sides--overreaction on the part of some police, who were under great harassment, who were obviously taunted to a point of almost exhaustion by the provocators--who you do not represent.  Let's just make it quite clear that there is a handful of people in this country that have made it very, very clear to everyone that they are out to cause trouble, and when they say they intend to have two or three hundred other Chicagos across the country, that they intend to upset the universities and intend to lie down in voting booths--these are not people who believe in democracy, these are Hitler youths--storm troop tactics.  There is a lot of other ways to demonstrate.  Have you ever noticed that the provocators never get bloodied?  They are like general staff officers, a half mile behind.  They get the young people.  I shouldn't be advertising newspapers, but this paper doesn't always treat me as kindly as I would like.  In fact, I would like to speak to a couple of their reporters today.

By the way, I'm not just a Democrat.  I look at alternatives all the way down the line.  I said, prior to the convention--two life-long friends of mine, neither one were nominated, even though we seemed to agree, the people made us look like we disagreed--I said, I would be willing to support their candidacy.  I think either one would be better for the presidency than Mr. Nixon and Mr. Wallace.  And there's no doubt about that.  So, I would say Mr. O'Dwyer hasn't asked for my support; I don't want to hurt him if he thinks I can be of help to him, I would be glad to do it, but he's a Democrat and he's on the ticket and I'm a pretty good party man, I think.  I say party responsibility is rather important.  So, I would kind of like to wait to hear from Paul.  By the way, he was my most active supporter in 1960.

Also, you ought to remember that it takes two-thirds vote in the United States senate in Congress, to pass a constitutional amendment.  You have to have a Constitutional amendment.  I proposed this in 1950 in the Senate with William Langner as my co-sponsor.  I was for this when I was mayor of my city.  I was for Medicare for sixteen years before it became a law--and it's true--you don't get things in a hurry.  I fought hard for the right to vote at age eighteen, and I see at long last the American Bar Association supported it.  They didn't when I was first for it--they supported the direct election of presidents.  What we have to do--what I have to do is what you have to do--push for it.  Now, the President of the United States did recommend voting to the Congress at age eighteen.  President Johnson recommended that--I whispered in his ear one day that it was a good idea--I think he was going to do it anyway, because I whispered some other things in his ear, but I didn't get them.  But in all honesty about it, we tried and we ought to keep at it.  I want you to keep at it.  Some of the great veteran's organizations and others have come out for age eighteen.

The national assembly that's in Congress is an elective assembly.  To be sure, it doesn't have a broad basis, but it has a pretty good basis.  Eleven presidents of the United States were elected by minority votes, one by 37 percent.  Even the late beloved John Kennedy didn't get fifty percent.  We have had many instances in this country where we have been unable to produce more than a plurality.  Even in the war between the states, in spite of the fact that Abraham Lincoln said the unions are infallible, as long as we are going past our plane, I think you might want to ask about that elective government, quote and end quote, in North Vietnam.  Surely, there are South Vietnamese--so what--the terrorist organizations can be terrorist organizations despite its nationality or identity.  There isn't a shadow of a doubt that North Vietnam isn't aggressors.  There isn't any doubt they are in this land today--in Laos today, despite the 1962 agreement about Laos--and you know it and I know it.  So, let's quit kidding each other.

Are they willing to cease the fire, so we can negotiate?  The answer is no.  My friends, the roadblock for peace is not in Washington.  The roadblock for peace, regrettably, is in other parts of the world and one of them being Hanoi.  When you start going off on Guatemala and Bolivia, and so forth, may I suggest that emotion is no substitute for fact.  The American Ambassador was shot in cold blood, here, in Guatemala a couple weeks ago.  The United States is not trying to run Guatemala; we are not trying to run Bolivia.

Have you ever thought what it would be like if there were nuclear weapons in the East today?  Southeast Asia and India, Pakistan and that area?  What this treaty is for is to try to build a protective system to prevent the spread of nuclear weapon technology and the placement of nuclear weapons around the world.  I think this is in our national interest.  We have all the nuclear weapons that we will need, there's nothing in industry to deny us to make more.  I can tell you, as a member of that National Security Council you have enough to kill anybody, and you can do it twice, in case anybody should crawl out from under a rock.  It's a tragic thing to talk about.  The Soviet Union has enough weapons to obliterate this country.  There isn't a lack.  What we need is to prevent the spread of that activity and then cut back and I take sharp issue with Mr. Nixon, who on the one hand says he favors the treaty but on the other hand says, not now.  Now is the time when the tensions in the world are rising, when we are the people that propose it, when we know it is in our national interest, when we know it has no relationships, at all, to what happened in Czechoslovakia.

All of the opportunities it has passed by, which in some cases can never be regained, the untapped treasures of Alaska are only a part of the untapped treasures of the United States--water resources, mineral resources, natural resources of every kind, and above all, human resources--and it is a source of interest and satisfaction that the two Americans in this century who did more to develop the natural resources of the United States were both from the Eastern United States and the state of New York: Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt.  The untapped energies of the American people, which are more powerful than the atom itself, must once again be committed to great national objectives. The Alaskan frontier was not won by men who were satisfied and complacent with what they had. They were not going to stay where they were and let a great opportunity pass them by. And this state is not going to realize its potential as long as it is approached from long range distance by those who are fainthearted. Since the convention in Los Angeles, I have been asked on many occasions what do I mean by a new frontier. But there is no need for that question here in the state of Alaska, for this is a state and a people who know the meaning of hardship and peril, who show spirit and dedication in their daily lives and who know that hard work and great hearts can win again the new frontier. This is a great state, but it can be a greater state; and the United States is a great nation, the greatest nation on earth, but it can be a greater nation, a nation whose strength will be respected by our friends and enemies alike. To build this state and nation is not simply a task for the Democratic party, and this presidential election is not simply a contest between two parties. Nineteen hundred and sixty, whether we wish it or not, whether there were an election or not, is a turning point in our history.

The first of those is the question of this tragic, cruel, and unjustified war that still continues in Southeast Asia. Now we have a chance in 1972 to do something about that. Four years ago, Mr. Nixon told us on the 9th of October, when he was a candidate, that those who could not bring peace in four years don't deserve another chance, and I agree with that. I know that there are other very serious and difficult problems before this country, but the truth is that we are not really going to bring the resources of mind and heart and spirit and body to the solution of these other problems until we cut out this great cancer that is eating away at the very soul of this nation. This is problem number one to the next president of the United States: to end that war and to end it without delay. And the other great question we have to answer in 1972 is whether we want a government that directs its interest for the benefit of the people, or whether we want a government that will continue for another four years to do the special interest bidding of some of the forces of greed and privilege in this country that have literally dominated the priorities and the policies of the Nixon administration.

First of all, let's recognize a fundamental fact. You hear a lot of talk about the farm problem these days, and from a political standpoint it's a difficult one. But let's never forget that there is no greater asset that we have in our struggle with the forces of slavery than the tremendous incredible productivity of America's farmers. Mr. Khrushchev knows this. He told me when he got back to Washington that he was pretty impressed with what he saw on the farms in Iowa that he visited, and he has reason to know it and I'll tell you why: because here in the United States approximately 6.5 million farmers and farmworkers produce as much as 50 million farmers and farmworkers produce in the Soviet Union. That, you see, gives us a tremendous advantage which we must retain. But since we owe this to our farmers, we must see that our farmers get what they do not receive today, and that is a fair share of America's increasing prosperity, and this can be done. The problem is difficult.

He has a thing about arms control.  He says the supporters of the freeze are dupes of Moscow when, in fact, those of us who want to control armaments, who want a freeze, I believe are speaking not only for a vast majority of the American people, but we are saying what needs to be done to control this madness before it destroys us all.

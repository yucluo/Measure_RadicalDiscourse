7.49140274147582e-05,0.999925085972585,1021_9,0,"There always has to be a whistle in a whistle-stop, as far as I can see. May I thank the band for coming out here this morning. You have done me a great courtesy, and I am very grateful to you."
6.61732558331282e-05,0.999933826744167,1023_2,0,"My heart is very much in these programs because whenever you travel through this great land of ours, you can't help but see how much these programs have meant to so many people. Above all, our Democratic platform calls for action on the overshadowing problems of war and peace--the most important unfinished business of our generation--and I mean steady resistance to Communism and patient and persistent efforts to build a peace which has been man's dearest goal from time immemorial. Now, in these few words--if these were all that you knew about me and about our Democratic platform, well, I will have to confess that you wouldn't know very much for it is easy to get up here on a campaign train and say some nice sounding words, but out of our party you get a lot more than some high sounding words--you get first of all the record of twenty years of solid accomplishment, of accomplishment in the interests of all our people, and I hope you will compare this record with the Republican record before you vote--for, by the way, they have a record too during these past twenty years, and it is easy to sum up that record. Whenever there has been a forward looking, a constructive program to oppose, they have opposed it, and that is about all their record amounts to."
6.72562014374616e-05,0.999932743798563,1023_6,0,"And I wish that these men of little faith could see America, as I have seen it; could talk to the countless thousands that I have had the privilege of meeting with, like you here this afternoon, all across our broad rich land during these past two months. America is a great, a strong, a wise, and most of all a good country. And I believe with all my heart that by these qualities, we can and we will safely in God's good time win our way to a peaceful world."
7.57888199722832e-05,0.999924211180027,1033_17,0,"But if we deal with this problem foolishly, we risk atomic war, on the one hand, or ignominious surrender, on the other--in either case, the destruction of freedom and civilization. I ask you: to whom should our people entrust the fight against Communism--to those Old Guard Republicans who, on one issue after another, vote the way our enemies like to see them vote? Or to those who have rallied the free world against Communist aggression?"
0.000245106550156524,0.999754893449843,1033_28,1,"As I have said repeatedly in this campaign, if I find any Communists or fellow travelers or Soviet agents or dupes in our federal government, I will root them out promptly and ruthlessly. In fighting Communists at home, I shall rely on such experienced guardians of our security as J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and General Bedell Smith of the Central Intelligence Agency. These men fight Communism as it must be fought--with care, thoroughness, precision--and silence."
7.1882060271861e-05,0.999928117939728,1035_0,0,"Mayor Capeless and my friends: I hope the time will never come when I believe all of the nice things that introducers say about me. In all events, I am very grateful to all of you for being here this afternoon. I have just had a most interesting experience. I was presented on the rear platform of the train with an enormous placard--here it is--they are all of the Ike buttons, gathered by the Volunteers for Stevenson from people who have switched."
7.58937235787408e-05,0.999924106276421,1040_8,0,"You know, they used to say in Washington in the early days of the war that you were likely to contract one of three diseases--either ulcers, galloping frustration, or a sense of humor. I have never felt better; I feel frustrated only by the difficulty I have had in engaging in any genuine debate with the Republicans; and, as far as my sense of humor is concerned, I hope it is intact. And I hope the time will never come when the Republican party gets into office and forbids any humor in political campaigns."
7.93576890311544e-05,0.999920642310969,1068_1,0,"I am most grateful to all of you for coming out here at this inconvenient hour and I appreciate your courtesy, and I am sure that your presence here is a good omen both for the Democratic party and for our country. When so many people get up so early in the morning to hear about the great issues on which we will make a decision next Tuesday, we can all feel confident that the future of America rests in responsible hands. It is a sign that every one of you is taking seriously your duty as a citizen; for, in our country it is the people who make all of the final decisions."
6.89390630037366e-05,0.999931060936996,1081_7,0,"     We Democrats are for private and we are for profitable business.  We know America could not survive with any other kind.  We are for the dynamic system of enterprise which has grown out of the great partnership of public and private initiative in this country.  We are against socialism--creeping, crawling, loping, galloping, or even the make-believe kind that takes up so much space in the Republican oratory these days."
7.17122983835448e-05,0.999928287701617,1082_7,0,"     And their voting record on farm policy is open for everyone to examine.  It is a record of opposition and harassment for 20 years, not only on price supports, but on all of the other Democratic programs on the storage program, rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, rural electric coops and so on.  The Republican Old Guard has never understood the philosophy behind these programs; it has never understood the programs themselves; it has never understood how they work.  The warning is plain; the Old Guard is hoping that the General can make his easy promises to farmers so convincing that they will forget about their own voting record."
6.80010039298364e-05,0.99993199899607,1085_15,0,"No, I've seen and heard the deep-throated courage and confidence and faith of strong men and women and happy children--people who still believe in one another, in spite of all the timid, doubting men. And I thank them every one for the reception they have given me--for their infinite courtesy and their heartening friendliness.  I have asked you for your support for my candidacy. I ask you now for support of our common faith in this country. The confidence we've inherited is our greatest wealth, the source of our strength. "
7.1180600459775e-05,0.99992881939954,1114_3,0,"So, in all of our problems of the preservation of Constitutional forms, in the determination that Communism shall not take over our government, in the determination that Communism abroad shall not present to us an unbearable threat, let us remember this:  We are first of all defending the basic tenets of our Constitutional government that each man is a spiritual being created in the image of his God. Once we have gotten that thought in our minds so that we never forget it, ladies and gentlemen, we can clean out corruption.  Why, think of it, think of the votes we can roll up on November 4th.  We can bring down taxes; we can stop the terrific taxes that are piling up your prices.  An economist came into me the other day, one of these fellows, you know, that dig out the facts.  Every time you eat a boiled egg, unless you raise it yourself, you pay 100 taxes on that egg, one hundred taxes and then we wonder where the prices come from."
6.87151523764025e-05,0.999931284847623,1130_11,0,"A government in which the people can have faith will restore the people's faith in government, and strengthen their faith in each other. Here is something else we are going to cast out--governmental domination of the people it is supposed to serve.  When I talk about this you may get the idea that I am trying to be philosophical or highbrow, but believe me, this thing affects the lives of every one of us.  Like the rest of the things we will cast out, this too is a product of fear and lack of faith in the people.  This idea that government is the people's master is widespread in our world.  It is called by many names, but it always leads to the same destination.  It puts the gears of progress in reverse and carries society back to the days when the king was government and government was the final goal and the only power."
7.24274922843267e-05,0.999927572507716,1132_3,0,"The great question of our time is peace.  Are we going to have a kind of peace that will allow our nation to live tranquilly, prosperously, as it goes forward leading the free nations of the world, or is it going to live in fear, hysteria and doubt with our young men never knowing whether they are going to be home or going to be sent to a foreign shore, whether we are going to be calm and peaceful in our homes or whether we are going to live in this hateful fear.  I think the young men and women of today are really going to settle this question."
6.8596879073816e-05,0.999931403120926,1156_13,0,"No one, not even the blindest partisan, can call this a proud record.  At times the pitiless pressure of Communism has been checked by brave emergency attempts that rallied men of all parties to make up the deficiencies in our national leadership.  These attempts have produced the economic help of the Marshall Plan and the program of military aid to Greece and Turkey.  Both were enactments of the Republican 80th Congress, the Congress so long vilified by the administration.  These measures have helped to steady both the economic and the nervous systems of our allies.  They could hardly have been expected to do more in the making of our foreign policy.  Dollars and guns are no substitute for brains and willpower."
6.84133427263116e-05,0.999931586657274,1166_11,0,"In short the entire government will work for the good of 155 million people, not just for this group, for that group, but for all Americans.  Now, in this crowd, ladies and gentlemen, there are numbers of men who are my old comrades in arms.  Some of them may have fought in the Far Pacific; some may have had duties that kept them in the U.S.; many of them went abroad with me.  And I used to see those fellows along the roads, in the camps, sometimes at reviews, in their barracks, in their kitchen, wherever; and we used to talk about why we were fighting.  And we came to the agreement in simple terms that we were fighting to keep America the kind of land that we believe it to be--a land of freedom and opportunity, not a land dominated by a Hitler or by any group of bureaucrats.  The reason I am in this political campaign, my friends, is in a continuation of that promise.  I am trying to do my part to keep America the kind of country we have always known, which means first of all that you must have a government you can respect and other nations will likewise respect it because you do.  "
7.32686045330238e-05,0.999926731395467,1174_9,0,"Can this burden be lightened without endangering national security? A Democrat administration--stale and self-satisfied from being too long in power complacently says: No, nothing can be done. That is not an American answer. Our answer is: Yes, much can be done."
6.72424456297972e-05,0.99993275755437,1179_4,0,"That record is a distinguished one.  It should be remembered that the negative votes on the North Atlantic Treaty, the Vandenberg Resolution and the Marshall Plan included negative votes of the party in power.  That is a tribute not just to a man but to a party.  Senator Vandenberg, if he were living, would be the first one to resent the suggestion that the votes to which I refer represented a personal triumph.  Rather, they represented to him the dedication of a party which, although it was an opposition party, subordinated partisan considerations to the national welfare."
7.35965690234669e-05,0.999926403430977,1183_0,0,"Ladies and gentlemen: there is not much relationship between the military life that I led for forty-one years and the kind of campaigning that I am now doing, but every once in a while I am reminded of certain rules or maxims in habits from that life, and one of them was, Never allow yourself to be surprised.  I was told that the last stop at Grand Rapids, Now, this is where you say goodbye to Michigan.  And then as we came along, a couple of your finest salesmen from Kalamazoo said, We are going to slow up the train as you go through Kalamazoo and you wave at some people.  Then later they said, Now, we'll tell you what we want to do.  We'll stop there a second and you just go on out and say hello and go on with your work.  I'll tell you this; it's a funny kind of a slowing down and a funny kind of a way to a little neighborhood crowd.  I am completely flabbergasted and I am certainly honored."
6.92271480951371e-05,0.999930772851905,1188_9,0,"I do not propose to talk tonight as if the American people had not lived through a great depression.  Its causes were many, and its costs in human distress were terrible. It is our pledge that the full power of government and every national resource will be devoted to seeing that it shall never again happen in America."
0.000115268404285511,0.999884731595715,1197_18,0,"As you know, the collector of internal revenue in one of our great districts is a high federal official.  Nine of them have been relieved for malfeasance or for cheating, or for something else wrong.  Some are behind bars--not long enough--but they are there because they lined their pockets with your money.  That has got to stop.  That is one thing that you don't have to stand for. "
6.78167336001974e-05,0.9999321832664,1206_6,0,"We will find a better answer than setting up in this region a super-state, a valley authority set up and blueprinted in Washington, D.C. with all of its principal officials appointed from there. Another of those blanks is that the Republican leaders would like to abolish all the gains that labor has made through these last years since the beginning of the century.  Ladies and gentlemen, sheer bunk!  I am not going to take time this morning to outline what the Republican Party is attempting to do in establishing the kind of climate in Washington where the labor-management problems can be settled without strikes, but I am going to repeat just briefly the promise I made to labor on Labor Day.  I said something to this effect: that four years from now, if you people had decided this fall to establish a Republican administration in Washington in the Executive Department, in the Senate of the United States, and in the Congress, that the leaders of that group would hope to stand before a crowd like this at the end of those four years, and each of you could look at the other and honestly say, Those people were fair; they were just; they settled everything on the basis of what is good for the United States of America, not just some particular section or group whose votes they were trying to buy--what was good for the United States of America.  Moreover, they would say and you would say to each other, They protected the rights of all--labor, management, professional men, farmers, everyone.  And finally, you would say, And besides being fair and just, they were friendly.  They were just people who belonged to us, one of us, not a bunch of long-haired bureaucrats in Washington who wanted to rule our lives from 3,000 miles away.  That was the pledge I made and I make it everywhere I go."
7.11324571083444e-05,0.999928867542892,1210_2,0,"First of all, of course, corruption is an expense piled onto all of the necessary expenditures that you people must bear.  By this I mean the actual cost in dollars is something that you have to add onto all these wasteful and extravagant expenses, as well as the necessary expenses.  But the great damage done to us by corruption in government is, after all, not just the few dollars it takes out of our tax revenues and our pockets.  This mess in Washington lowers our prestige abroad and robs us of pride in our own government.  If we are going to restore pride in government, who is going to do it?  You can't take an organization that has been in power far too long and merely by doing a little face-lifting job, doing a little repaint job, get by with it.  Actually, I believe that the administration candidate said all it needed was a little refreshening.  But as far as I am concerned, how do you refreshen a bad egg?"
8.07024689965302e-05,0.999919297531003,1220_40,0,"In this enterprise which I describe, we are not trying to remake the world in the image of America.  We are not trying to force any man to our way if it is not his.  We are not trying to buy peace or bring peace with the sword."
7.2679611057028e-05,0.999927320388943,1226_0,0,"My first and most pleasant duty, of course, is to thank you for coming out here today.  You give me a chance to look in your faces, to bring you a word of greeting, and to give you one or two of the thoughts that are on my mind as we go through this political campaign.  I have had a wonderful day and a half in your state, starting up at Sacramento.  It seems to me I have been covering ground very rapidly and every place there seems to be a new surprise.  Now, for example, here when the so-called professional politicians began to give me my lessons in this new art a few months back, they told me there was one thing you could not do-go to an airport and address a group of American citizens.  I was told they simply wouldn't come.  So I find out today that at least in Long Beach those political friends of mine were wrong, and I am delighted."
6.92626075408421e-05,0.999930737392459,1233_24,0,"The Republicans have not only participated in every one of our enlightened farm programs, protection of farmers against disasters where they can't protect themselves, but they have pledged this:  When it comes time in the future to begin to study these programs and how we adjust them to changing and future conditions, farmers will be brought in and farm leaders will be brought in.  They will be consulted, and not the way they are consulted now:  You do this or you will get no more.  They will be consulted on what is the problem of their locality.  We have no intention in this crusade of getting a bunch of long-haired Brannan experts to come out and run your farms.  We figure you can do it a little better."
7.3121084535884e-05,0.999926878915464,1234_6,0,"This whole-hog theory is that the local citizen--the rancher, the farmer, the municipal government, the state government--don't know anything about their business, and they shouldn't attempt to do anything for themselves but should wait for Washington to tell them how to do it. Now, there are obviously many things that Washington must come in and help if we are going to develop this great West the way it must be developed--and that means to the limit of its capacity to absorb development--but when they do come in, the federal government must come in as a partner; they must take seriously and earnestly the advice and the counsel of the people who are on the spot, and if we don't do that the West will never be developed as it should be. The crusade upon which we are now embarked has that as one of its purposes--in every section, to pay respect, to give due influence to the knowledge and information that local people have on their own problems and not try to do these things from Washington."
7.32005136547704e-05,0.999926799486346,1270_17,0,"We must call upon the best minds of our nations to sit down with political and economic leaders of other nations to find solutions to the crucial problems of international economic policy.  I believe that the wrecking of the London Economic Conference of 1933 was one of the great, though little understood, tragedies of our modern world.  We must make a fresh start."
6.93044955174869e-05,0.999930695504483,1300_38,0,"A: You know, fortunately, Mr. Nagel, this morning there was a very significant item in the paper. It was this: There was quoted a top-secret document of the American Defense Department. How it got there, we will never know probably. But that top-secret document brought out one fact that really answers your question. It was this. There was a military estimate made in September 1947 by military men, and it had this conclusion: The military occupation of South Korea is not essential to the military security of the United States of America."
7.17296703464631e-05,0.999928270329653,1308_18,0,"Ladies and gentlemen, already I have been notified by my associates in front of me that I have used up far more than my time.  I do want to thank each of you who has come out here this morning and given me this time from his busy day not only to bring him a greeting but to allow me to express a few of these thoughts that are on my mind as we go through this political campaign.  I haven't anything in shopworn promises to offer you, but I do tell you this:  When this campaign started and we had some smoothly flowing, high sounding language from the opposition as to what they were going to do--I made a pledge."
6.9054403140904e-05,0.999930945596859,1314_11,0,Tied to that problem is this one of Civil Service.  You put Ike and his friends in the administration and they will fire civil servants by the scores.  That is just bunk.  I have lived with those people a whole lot longer than some of the people who are now criticizing me and I like and admire them.
6.96871145483383e-05,0.999930312885451,1322_4,0,"I want to pay tribute, on the Labor Day, to the magnificent role that American labor, under the leadership of the AFL-CIO, has played in the world wide struggle with Communism. No agency, public or private, has been more effective in arousing the hearts and minds of the plain people of the Free World to an awareness of the menace. By its leadership in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, American labor has welded the free trade unions of every nation into a solid front against Communism."
7.10937353663247e-05,0.999928906264633,1323_0,0,"Fellow veterans, fellow Legionnaires. I can't help remembering that when I said fellow veterans to you at this convention four years ago I did so with a considerable degree of self-consciousness. My brief service as an Apprentice Seaman in 1918 hardly seemed like a sufficient claim to veteran status."
7.46520581510001e-05,0.999925347941849,1326_14,0,"There is not peace--real peace--while more than half of our federal budget goes to an armaments race with the most powerful military despotism the world has ever known, and the earth's atmosphere is contaminated from week to week by exploding hydrogen bombs. There is not peace--which can only mean world peace--while millions chafe in Communist chains. In Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and even some parts of Latin America, ugly tension and unbridled nationalism are mixed up, often in dangerous ways, with hopes and aspirations we all respect. "
7.84116040122071e-05,0.999921588395988,1327_2,0,"Well, the American people won't be fooled. What matters is not what it says on the label, but what is inside the package. And inside the Republican package is the same old stuff, the same Old Guard, the same old promises they make every four years. They still shine--but then, why shouldn't they? They've never been used."
7.12144118697248e-05,0.99992878558813,1342_3,0,"Yet only a few weeks later he made his unhappy peace with the party. That was when he said, on October 30, 1953, that he favored the election of every Republican over every Democrat for every office any place. And that is the course he has pursued ever since. He has not hesitated to endorse any Republican, be he a Taft Republican or a McCarthy Republican. The only notable exception was an Eisenhower Republican--Senator Wiley of Wisconsin, for whom the President didn't lift a finger. It used to be said that Mr. Eisenhower would reshape the Republican party. You cannot help but wonder today who has reshaped whom."
6.77040093618255e-05,0.999932295990638,1364_8,0,"Does the President really object to his administration being called indifferent to unemployment? I remind him that his Secretary of Defense talked about workers out of jobs as kennel or hunting dogs, and that it was a White House assistant who said of unemployment this spring that the right to suffer is one of the joys of a free economy. And I want to say something, too, about another kind of indifference. I mean about the crisis in education in this country. The President said last night that twice in his State of the Union messages--in 1955 and 1956--he urged swift action--and that he even called a conference on education."
7.18234420997495e-05,0.9999281765579,1374_9,0,"I believe that the need for this interaction--for this balanced and reciprocal cooperation--has never been greater than it is today. For our society is in a state of transition. We have moved out of the bleak past, when our problem was scarcity and our task the hard one of distributing too few goods among too many people. We are finally entering that age of abundance, of which we have dreamed so long."
6.72688374552757e-05,0.999932731162545,1377_5,0,"At Peoria, four years later, the President told his Republican audience that what he meant at Kasson, was that farmers should get their parity in the marketplace. If that means anything, it means they should get parity without price supports. And if that is what Mr. Eisenhower meant, why didn't he say so four years ago? He didn't say so because he knew that any such statement would have cost him."
7.17006738293856e-05,0.99992829932617,1389_20,0,"The Republican party has no program to offer America, no policy, no philosophy. In fact, it seems to have little else but President Eisenhower--who in the next years would inevitably recede more and more from the picture. The fact is that the Republican administration has taken everything from the Democratic past--and offers nothing to the American future."
7.14664653151877e-05,0.999928533534684,1389_21,0,"Oh yes, it has one thing to offer to the American future: It has the vice president of the United States. Every consideration--the President's age, his constitutional position under the Twenty-second amendment--makes it inevitable that the dominant figure in the Republican party under a second Eisenhower term would be Richard Nixon. The emergence of this man raises grave questions."

We live in a time of revolutionary change. Before our eyes, in the very headlines of our daily papers, a new world is being born."

The project itself is a good example of one phase of the partnership principle which this administration believes in as applying to the conservation of resources.

Other Democratic presidents in this country--Woodrow Wilson, who served in this city, in this state, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman--all faced difficult and dangerous times.

The House of Representatives is Democratic by a wide margin, and I doubt that the Democrats in the House of Representatives will lose control. Therefore, the prospect of four or eight years of a divided government, a government manned by a highly partisan figure, manned by a highly partisan party in the executive branch, and we have seen evidence of it in the last few days--how can we hope, at a time when we need action, how can we hope to possibly move ahead when on the one hand we say yes with the Democrats, and on the other hand we say no with the Republicans?

My judgment is that there is a very clear choice between the Republican and the Democratic parties.  They stand for different things, and they have stood for different things all through this century.  Woodrow Wilson, running in 1912, said that the Republican party idea of policy is to sit on the lid.  Franklin Roosevelt carried the fight in 1932 and 1936 and Harry Truman carried the fight in 1948, and on the issues which matter, housing, social security, medical care for the aged, minimum wage, development of the resources of this country, I believe the Democratic party looks forward.

But instead of holding out a helping hand of friendship to the desperate people of Cuba, nearly all our aid was in the form of weapons assistance--assistance which merely strengthened the Batista dictatorship--assistance which completely failed to advance the economic welfare of the Cuban people--assistance which enabled Castro and the Communists to encourage the growing belief that America was indifferent to Cuban aspirations for a decent life."

I just come here in this community, which is mixed, Democrats, Republicans and independents, because two weeks from today, November 8th, Mr. Nixon's and my work will be finished and then you have to decide, you have to make these judgments.  But what is the area of difference between us?  What is the issue on which you should base your decision?  You should not only make a judgment of Mr. Nixon and myself.  You should also make a judgment about yourselves, what you want, about what your view is of your country and your community, about what your view of the future is, whether you are satisfied today or wish to do better.  If you are satisfied, if you feel happy about your life, if you feel our country is meeting its responsibilities, then you belong in Mr. Nixon's camp.  But if you share the view that I hold very vigorously that this country is going to have to do better in the future, that we have responsibilities to meet not only to ourselves but to the cause of freedom, that we are anxious to make sure that in the future people decide that these days were great days in the life of our country, that we must move forward, we must stimulate our growth, we must hold out an image to the world of a vigorous, dynamic society, if we are going to continue to lead the free world--I believe that is the choice.

Mr. Nixon has run on a slogan that we have never had it so good.  It indicates his belief that we are moving in a period now, to quote him, of unparalleled prosperity, that the United States is moving in a position of strength and vitality, and that everything that must be done is being done in good measure.  He looks around the world and he sees the United States with our prestige at an all-time high, and that of the Communists at an all-time low.  I look at the world and I look at the United States, and I don't see his picture at all, and I am not, as the Democratic candidate for office, going to run for the presidency in 1960 with any belief or any view that it is worthwhile getting elected president if we have to run on a platform which is totally unrealistic.  This country is not moving ahead like it is going to have to move ahead if we are going to meet our responsibilities to ourselves, to those who come after us, to those who look to us around the world for leadership.  And our position in the world is not unparalleled; our prestige has been higher.  Our strength relative to that of the Communists has been greater.  If Mr. Nixon hopes to be president of the United States and present the United States to the world in the same image that he now presents it in this campaign, I could not disagree with him more.  I hope you share the view with me that we want the truth with the bark off.  The people of the United States want to face the facts.  You share the same view that I do, that this country's potential is unlimited.  There is no responsibility, no burden, no hazard that the United States cannot meet, but it certainly cannot meet those hazards unless the leadership is prepared to tell the truth.  "

The thing that ran through my mind I'm sure was what would run through your mind--that the most important question and the most important responsibility for the next president of the United States is to see that those boys and thousands like them are always in uniforms of peace and never have to be in uniforms of war. And so I say to you today that the most important responsibility of the next president is to keep the peace without surrender and that is the question you should ask--which of the candidates--which of the two for president and vice president will best provide that leadership.

I intend to take the offensive against crime.

The first responsibility Mr. Ford had after the nomination was to choose a vice presidential running mate, and I believe that any American watching the debate last night could assess the difference in the quality of those two men. I would trust Walter Mondale to be president in a minute, and I'm very, very proud of him, and I told him last night I was. This is a country that cries out for competence; it cries out for compassion; it cries out for restoration of our principles and our beliefs and our commitments to a standard of excellence and greatness that will make us all proud again."

May I salute our longstanding friends, George and Janet Voinovich, and say you are very lucky in this state to have this man as your governor. Also I want to single out another one, and that's Chalmers Wylie. He and I went to Congress on the same day, and he served Columbus with great distinction. If we had more like him they wouldn't be yelling all the time, Clean House! to get rid of all those Democrats that have been there in control for thirty-eight years, for thirty-eight years."

But we are great and we are strong, and we have a marvelous opportunity now with a better education system, a better child care system. I'm fighting for health care reform. I'm fighting to back up these police officers here who are trying to help us bring peace and tranquility to our neighborhoods, frustrated at every turn by the liberal Democrats. We are going to get a new crowd in Congress, and we are going to move this country forward. "

Barbara and I are in the middle of a great tour of this heartland of America, 233 miles from Ohio up through Michigan, building up for November 3rd. I have spelled out a comprehensive Agenda for American Renewal, a comprehensive, integrated, detailed plan so that in the twenty-first century, America will reign as the economic superpower in the entire world.

And, yes, we've got our challenges. But we should never forget that our people are still the best educated; our economy, in spite of a world slowdown, the best, the most dynamic; and our workers the most productive, more productive than any other workers in the entire world. And that is the fact. I am proud of what we've accomplished the past four years to strengthen America's leadership. We are respected around the entire world. And we are number one."

The last time we had this, do you remember what the misery index was? They invented it--20 percent; it's now 10. Do you remember what the interest rates were? Twenty-one and a half percent, with Carter in the White House and the libs controlling the Congress. We cannot go back.

But do not let the government run the health care program. And don't let the Congress do it. Congress can't run a two-bit bank or a two-bit post office. Don't let them do anything except change; change them out. Give Marge some company up there that's sensible like she is.

But let's look at what he offers. Change--tax and spend is what he's really talking about. Arkansas for the eighties lagged the nation in growth. And in 1991, Clinton says we did better; we led the nation. Well, the only way to get Arkansas' economy moving was for Governor Clinton to get out of the state. He was out of there in '91 running for president, the only time they did better than the national average."

When Dawn introduced me and talked a little bit about herself, I thought to myself: I wonder how many nontraditional students there are who have to balance work and school and taking care of kids. I bet a lot of you do.

Let's support our police on the street. Let's support the DARE offices in the schools, preaching safe and drug-free schools. I appointed a four-star general, General Barry McCaffrey, to lead our fight against drugs. His last post in the military required him to do everything he could to stop drugs from coming into our country as the commander of all of our forces south of our border. Today, he's in Los Angeles, carrying on that fight. But that's everyone's fight, and everyone has to take responsibility for waging it."

The strategy is opportunity for everyone, responsibility from everyone, and an American community where everyone--everyone--has a place, plays a role and we all grow stronger together.

And after four years, as Don Payne said, we've got 10.5 million new jobs, 4.5 million new homeowners, a record number of new small businesses, including in every year record numbers of new businesses owned by women and minorities. We have for the first time since before the Civil War cut the deficit in each one of the four years of my presidency. And we did it without gutting Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, and our commitment to the proposition that everybody in this country is entitled to be treated fairly and justly."

Sort of rev up the crowd. Superintendent Murray, Dr. Moriarty, Board of Education President Blackstone, to the other distinguished school officials and teachers who are here. Let me say when I got off the airplane today at the International Guard Terminal in Chicago, I was met by the Colonel there, who said, it's a really wonderful school that you're going to visit. And he said, I want you to have this flag pin and these bubble gum cards that those kids made for children in Bosnia. I want you to know what kind of a special place H-F is.

I had never worked in Washington, except as a college student, until I became president. And I didn't like what I saw. There were too many people spending their time asking, who can I blame for this problem; and too few people spending their time asking, what are we going to do about this problem. So we asked that question: What are we going to do? And then we proceeded to do it."

That's what that Brady Bill's all about. That's what that assault weapons ban's all about. He wants to take your gun away. He's going to interfere with your Second Amendment rights.

Now, who would have thought fifteen or twenty years ago at the height of the Cold War we could ever see the threat of communism fade from the world, that we would see the ugly rise of old racial and ethnic and religious hatreds consuming people all around the globe.

We can change it forever and for good, and we'll have every American in the mainstream, working, raising their children, being part of one society, not having some isolated forever and trapped in poverty if you will help us and we decide to do it together in every community of America.

People in Rwanda, in Burundi, people in Bosnia, people in Northern Ireland, people in the Middle East, people in Haiti--why can't people get along? Why do they have to look down on each other?

And so, good ol' Al, he explains it to the media, Oh, I was on an outreach program. So that will be the end of that. Nobody will look beyond that in the media. That's the end of that one."

I think we need a president who understands that the government is too big and takes too much of your money, your money, your money. And I now that in a crowd this size--the New York Times will write that not many people showed up--but the other papers will get it right. That a crowd this size--there are probably a lot of husbands and wives here--both are working; one to pay the bills for the family, the other to pay the taxes, which are now the highest in history, about 40 percent of what you earn goes for taxes. This should not happen in America."

Regardless of your party, regardless of your philosophy, nobody has a higher obligation than the president of the United States."

He stood for the things I think are right. He stood for them in the way that was right. I think of him particularly today because he retained--as mayor, governor, attorney general and supreme court justice--the humility which is all too rare a quality among democracy's leaders. He never, even from the heights of public service he reached, looked down on people. He always looked up to them. Recalling what Frank Murphy stood for is about the best advice a candidate for the presidency could give himself on Labor Day of this election year."

We have to continue to fight for equal rights and equal opportunities for every citizen in this country, no matter where his parents were born or what color his skin may be. Only if all of us in this country go forward together, arm in arm, can we preserve our freedom and bring peace in the world."

Projects and proposals from all parts of the country compete for public investment. I am not sure that the office of president is well enough equipped, as things now stand, to praise them with detachment and critical authority. The Hoover Commission has made suggestions for increasing the effectiveness of executive review; it may be that even better means can be devised, and I propose to find out. "

I don't think the tearful and interminable post-mortems about China will save any souls for democracy in the rest of Asia, the Near East, and in Africa. India is not caught up in civil strife. It can be helped in a way that is natural to us and best for it; help in the ways of peace and of social progress. India has to grow more food. It has to restore its land. It needs new resources of power. In short, it needs a democratic helping hand in the development programs it has already charted for itself."

You today accept the fact that, in the private free enterprise system which we all recognize as basic to our liberty and our prosperity, employees can prosper only as their employers do, and that irresponsible demands are only self-defeating. Yet American labor, like the Democratic party, faces new and uncharted tomorrows. You, as we, will be challenged anew to measure up to the demands of both freedom and power. The future of democracy, perhaps the future of our world, depends upon the exercise of power by America's private and public bodies alike with that self-restraint which separates power from tyranny and orderfrom chaos."

They cut out $300,000 and added $50,000,000! But I vetoed most of it; I vetoed more appropriations than any governor in Illinois history. So you will understand when I say that I think the carefully cultivated legend that all Democrats are wasters and all Republicans are economical is the bunk. I think this is a time for bare-bone economy and the Republican legislators in Illinois can tell you I mean what I say."

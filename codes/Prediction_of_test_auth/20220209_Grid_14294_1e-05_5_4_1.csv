Lately it seems to be too much in the nation.  We do these things together because no one can do them for himself alone.  We must approach those group problems with a spirit of cooperation, a readiness to accept the responsibilities of each of us which are group in character.  If we do not do that then there comes that creeping tide of central law that finally results in the all-powerful state, and we do it because we are regimented.  Let us do our jobs at home, first in the family, then in the village, then in the state.  Let's not let the central government get any more of them than we have to."
5.97086703234288e-05,0.999940291329676,1107_24,0,"Let me tell you plainly what I want to cast away, with the aid of a Republican Congress and Republican officials in the states. First, we shall cast away the incompetent, the unfit, the cronies, and the chiselers.  And it won't take years of Congressional investigation and a lot of tax money to clean out the mess."
5.68007526760939e-05,0.999943199247324,1146_2,0,"The British over on the left couldn't break out of the fortified town of Cannes, and we didn't know what we were going to do.  A little sergeant--Sergeant Kuhlen--I will never forget his name as long as I live--came up with an idea.  He found that he could put some knives on the front of our tanks that would go in and cut off these hedges.  The tanks could come through straight and come through shooting, and it wasn't very pleasant for the Germans. "
5.32884121327628e-05,0.999946711587868,1150_1,0,"I had a wonderful story told me about your town, that only last August in the midst of carrying on your fair you had a great storm that destroyed the buildings and tents and it looked like it was going to be disaster and no fair.  You people pitched in on your own.  You didn't even wait for a Washington bureaucrat to come down and do it.  You did it yourselves.  Moreover, I am told what you could expect in that little incident, that the elephant stayed on the job working until the last and the donkey played out--just too old, too tired."
5.16748987101196e-05,0.99994832510129,1155_3,0,"The policies they are now pursuing are destroying your insurance policies, your government bonds, your savings accounts and it is making it so that every day you must carry more money in your purse to the grocery store in order to get a decent basket of groceries.  If we do not stop that kind of thing, ladies and gentlemen, then America cannot be what it has been in the past.  We must have a solvent America, an America that lives within its means, yet so far have they gone with these spendthrift policies that the government itself says that last year every city family had to spend $400 more than that family could earn to pay for its shelter, its food, its clothing and other necessities in the family.  If that goes on, not only is this government going to be broke but all the families in it are going to be broke.  That is not America."
5.15117984827013e-05,0.999948488201518,1179_4,0,"That record is a distinguished one.  It should be remembered that the negative votes on the North Atlantic Treaty, the Vandenberg Resolution and the Marshall Plan included negative votes of the party in power.  That is a tribute not just to a man but to a party.  Senator Vandenberg, if he were living, would be the first one to resent the suggestion that the votes to which I refer represented a personal triumph.  Rather, they represented to him the dedication of a party which, although it was an opposition party, subordinated partisan considerations to the national welfare."
5.06246776077214e-05,0.999949375322392,1181_9,0,"Ladies and gentlemen, my train was late, our time is short, but you have met a part of the Michigan team--Michigan members that must be on this great team to help in cleaning out the Washington mess.  Your governor, your new Senator, your Congressman--we must have them all--and with them and on behalf of all Republicans, I make these pledges to labor, to farmers, to businessmen, to every American:  first, if you want to change administrations this fall, if you want the group that the Republicans can put in the administration and in the Senate and in the House to take charge of this thing--clean it out and start us on a different road than we are now following--then they promise this:  There will be fairness, decency and justice prevailing in that administration, and they will serve you honestly as your servants and will not attempt to be your master.  That is the first pledge they make."
5.97922871276191e-05,0.999940207712872,1193_16,0,"At a critical moment in World War II, we induced the Nazis to hold an entire army in reserve in the Calais area to meet an attack that they thought was coming but which we never intended to launch.  Measures to deceive them worked so effectively that they estimated our original strength in Europe at seventy-five divisions instead of the actual thirty-six. In the entire American record in Europe there is no single instance where the enemy gained essential information of our plans through the medium of spies or subversive agents."
5.0683054005108e-05,0.999949316945995,1206_6,0,"We will find a better answer than setting up in this region a super-state, a valley authority set up and blueprinted in Washington, D.C. with all of its principal officials appointed from there. Another of those blanks is that the Republican leaders would like to abolish all the gains that labor has made through these last years since the beginning of the century.  Ladies and gentlemen, sheer bunk!  I am not going to take time this morning to outline what the Republican Party is attempting to do in establishing the kind of climate in Washington where the labor-management problems can be settled without strikes, but I am going to repeat just briefly the promise I made to labor on Labor Day.  I said something to this effect: that four years from now, if you people had decided this fall to establish a Republican administration in Washington in the Executive Department, in the Senate of the United States, and in the Congress, that the leaders of that group would hope to stand before a crowd like this at the end of those four years, and each of you could look at the other and honestly say, Those people were fair; they were just; they settled everything on the basis of what is good for the United States of America, not just some particular section or group whose votes they were trying to buy--what was good for the United States of America.  Moreover, they would say and you would say to each other, They protected the rights of all--labor, management, professional men, farmers, everyone.  And finally, you would say, And besides being fair and just, they were friendly.  They were just people who belonged to us, one of us, not a bunch of long-haired bureaucrats in Washington who wanted to rule our lives from 3,000 miles away.  That was the pledge I made and I make it everywhere I go."
5.17262230747155e-05,0.999948273776925,1233_24,0,"The Republicans have not only participated in every one of our enlightened farm programs, protection of farmers against disasters where they can't protect themselves, but they have pledged this:  When it comes time in the future to begin to study these programs and how we adjust them to changing and future conditions, farmers will be brought in and farm leaders will be brought in.  They will be consulted, and not the way they are consulted now:  You do this or you will get no more.  They will be consulted on what is the problem of their locality.  We have no intention in this crusade of getting a bunch of long-haired Brannan experts to come out and run your farms.  We figure you can do it a little better."
5.15406171500829e-05,0.99994845938285,1234_6,0,"This whole-hog theory is that the local citizen--the rancher, the farmer, the municipal government, the state government--don't know anything about their business, and they shouldn't attempt to do anything for themselves but should wait for Washington to tell them how to do it. Now, there are obviously many things that Washington must come in and help if we are going to develop this great West the way it must be developed--and that means to the limit of its capacity to absorb development--but when they do come in, the federal government must come in as a partner; they must take seriously and earnestly the advice and the counsel of the people who are on the spot, and if we don't do that the West will never be developed as it should be. The crusade upon which we are now embarked has that as one of its purposes--in every section, to pay respect, to give due influence to the knowledge and information that local people have on their own problems and not try to do these things from Washington."
5.45485561064677e-05,0.999945451443893,1236_7,0,It is wonderful to visit Houston and see on every hand the signs of your vigorous expansion.  You have fulfilled the vision of those hardy pioneers who set up the early capital of the Texas republic down at the corner of Main Street and Texas Avenue.  You have vindicated their resolute belief in the unlimited future of this region.  Your growth has been phenomenal--the vast industrial development ringing the city; your beautiful churches; your Rice Institute; your University of Houston; your wonderful medical center; and your other institutions of culture and learning.
5.9795964963579e-05,0.999940204035037,1238_22,0,"The Achilles heel of any nation is spiritual poverty.  Aggressive nations seek out such weakness in the same way a bully seeks out a weakling for his attack.  There are national bullies yet in this world, ready to seize upon signs of weakness in our American spirit--our faith, our confidence, our determination."
5.17833017021938e-05,0.999948216698298,1249_17,0,"There is a cruel duplicity involved on the part of an administration which has pledged social security for some, and then through waste and careless financial policies, has caused an inflationary insecurity for all. And now we come to another glaring example of our national leadership's failure to live up to high ideals.  I refer to the McCarran Immigration Law, which was passed over the president's veto at the last session of Congress.  A new immigration law was certainly needed.  But with leadership, rather than vetoes, we should have had, and we must get, a better law than this McCarran Act."
5.36534562140139e-05,0.999946346543785,1293_2,0,"I am exceedingly proud, my friends, to address you in a hall that is a war memorial, dedicated to our veterans. I hear that more than twenty-thousand people contributed their funds to make this hall possible.  Whenever anything comes to my attention that involves veterans, I, like most other old soldiers, want to reminisce a bit.  Never do I get tired of reminiscing about the heroism, the sacrifices, the devotion to our country of the millions of men and women who made up our fighting forces in World War II.  I am really proud that the city of Johnstown has chosen to take a building such as this that will be used by your citizenry through the years to make it a lasting useful memorial to their services."
5.50434830668201e-05,0.999944956516933,1295_12,0,"Those days must not return.  They will not return.  To prevent their return, I pledge to enlist all the resources of private industry and mobilize all the resources of our government to prevent the specter of mass unemployment for once again visiting our land."
5.03249714268941e-05,0.999949675028573,1302_2,0,"And now, my friends, when this campaign started, we were promised--a very high-sounding promise, put in very nicely-flowing words--that the United States was going to be given the spectacle of a political contest conducted on such a plane, the opposition said that we would be all educated and elevated.  It was a very, very wonderful promise.  I sincerely appreciated it, but what has happened?  If you are going to educate, you have to start with the record, with the facts.  Who among you here would like the job of defending the record of the government of the past seven years?  Well, I don't have to ask that one again.  Of course, they can't defend that record, a record in which, with all of the assets and resources of this great nation with which we came out of World War II, they have frittered them away--as they have struggled and fumbled and stumbled and fallen in the foreign field.  They have brought us no closer to peace.  We have had these emergencies after emergencies.  We have lost China.  We have lost souls, human souls, to the Communistic dictatorship in the Kremlin at the rate of 100 million per year."
7.45028541046316e-05,0.999925497145896,1303_4,0,"The essential difference between this worn-out bureaucracy in Washington and the crusade is this:  They want to sit in Washington and direct your lives and your businesses and check up on you from thousands or hundreds of miles away.  We want to see you develop yourselves with every single thing you have got in you and hold the government ready to help you whenever it is necessary, but to work with you and not just to work you. We believe that if we bring to Washington the outstanding men and women of this crusade--your representatives, people coming right out of this crowd, men who have been introduced to you from this platform--that all of those people will be your guarantee that there is no crookedness in government, that subversion and Communism isn't getting inside of government.  They will be your guarantee that if a stray individual does go bad and betrays his trust, that kind of thing will be ripped out of government without delay."
0.000136834417082537,0.999863165582917,1312_11,0,"What is extraordinary is that the present administration continues to pretend that none of these things have been so--that everything that has happened--every stolen secret, every disloyal official--is, they say, just an unfortunate, almost insignificant, accident. We could make some allowance for them if they had the honesty or the common sense, or both, to admit that they had been deceived and to show a stern purpose of preventing similar subversion in the future. There has been considerable concern--and rightfully so--about methods to be used in rooting Communism out of our government."
5.37442744293288e-05,0.99994625572557,1313_9,0,"Every single member in this crusade is pledged to this idea: That at the first sign of any approaching depression, the full power of private industry, of local and state government, and all resources of federal government will be mobilized to see that never again will we have mass unemployment.  We are committed to the expansion and improvement of social security programs, particularly to saving what is left of our dollars so that your insurance policies, your old age insurance, your unemployment insurance and the rest of itdon't run out of your pocket through that big hole they call inflation.  Unless we stop that, there is no hope."
5.17691804194745e-05,0.99994823081958,1342_3,0,"Yet only a few weeks later he made his unhappy peace with the party. That was when he said, on October 30, 1953, that he favored the election of every Republican over every Democrat for every office any place. And that is the course he has pursued ever since. He has not hesitated to endorse any Republican, be he a Taft Republican or a McCarthy Republican. The only notable exception was an Eisenhower Republican--Senator Wiley of Wisconsin, for whom the President didn't lift a finger. It used to be said that Mr. Eisenhower would reshape the Republican party. You cannot help but wonder today who has reshaped whom."
5.00985557923821e-05,0.999949901444208,1343_6,0,"Four years ago, the voters could reasonably believe that Mr. Eisenhower's personal crusade would alter traditional Republican policies and, indeed, remake the Republican party in his own image. Today, the record makes it clear that this has not been done--and circumstances make it certain that it will not be done in the four years ahead. It was not, as some sought to suggest, the habit of the past that sustained your faith in the Democratic party in 1952. It was rather your vision of the future. It is true that Southerners have long memories, and many bitter things to remember. But it is also true that the South is caught up today in a rushing pattern of change that makes this in many ways the most exciting and the most promising region in our country."
5.46433123763767e-05,0.999945356687624,1355_11,0,We must work out a program that will mean real security--and dignity and meaningfulness--in the lives of our older citizens. There are great unmet needs for more schools and teachers for our children. There are slums to be closed.
5.11597637188754e-05,0.999948840236281,1367_14,0,"The Democratic party, in a free and open convention, chose as our candidate for vice president, one of the great spokesmen in this country today for the rights of man--Senator Estes Kefauver. The Republican party, in a convention that was not free and not open, threw out Joe Smith and, with President Eisenhower's blessing, nominated Richard Nixon. The contrast between these two men and the contrast in the manner in which they were nominated tells much about the difference between our two parties."
5.24903441489031e-05,0.999947509655851,1367_28,0,"What the Old Guard Republican leaders did to get their man in was to decide, coldly and with due calculation, that the personal popularity of one man was great enough that the general distrust of another wouldn't matter. They concluded, or rather they hoped, that enough voters would cast a ballot for one man's popularity without regard to the possible consequences if another became President. I think they were wrong. I think the people of this country do not view the vice presidency-- at least in these times-- as a casual incident. They know what the vice presidency is this nation's life insurance policy. They are going to read the fine print. And I don't think they are going to go for four years uninsured."
5.11302559411629e-05,0.999948869744059,1369_5,0,"When there was a strike at the auto agency of this Cabinet businessman his comment was: I don't happen to go along with some of the goons they've got running things. Is that what they think of labor? When small-business failures reach an alarming rate, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior says, There are business failures even in times of great prosperity. It is part and parcel of our American way of life... I do not think we would want it different. Is that what they think of small business?"
5.09243231550948e-05,0.999949075676845,1391_15,0,"And distasteful as this matter is, I must say bluntly that every piece of scientific evidence we have, every lesson of history and experience, indicates that a Republican victory tomorrow would mean that Richard M. Nixon would probably be president of this country within the next four years. I say frankly, as a citizen more than a candidate, that I recoil at the prospect of Mr. Nixon as custodian of this nation's future, as guardian of the hydrogen bomb, as representative of America in the world, as Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces. Distasteful as it is, this is the truth, the central truth, about the most fateful decision the American people have to make tomorrow. I have full confidence in that decision."
5.28668834445316e-05,0.999947133116555,1402_46,0,"THE PRESIDENT. Well, they propose to do plenty and are--well, I say are--not plenty, they are doing a lot and they expect to do more. Among other things, you know social security has been extended to many more people in the last couple of years--ten million more. We have gone into special housing programs for the aged. There has been special medical research in the diseases of the aged. There have been special programs started in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare so that the people that are chronically ill, although not acutely ill, could have proper hospital care or proper care within a hospital center. All of that kind of thing is being done and more will be done. But the great thing is, as I see it, to give them finally the income on which they can live in self-respect and dignity, even if they don't live quite as actively as they did when they were younger."
5.65827193359726e-05,0.999943417280664,1405_33,0,He has done an effective job for this state and for all the states of the union. He has served with vigor and forthrightness. He has shown us a great dedication.
5.18561664500564e-05,0.99994814383355,1417_1,0,"I should tell you that, in a very real sense, I am here today as president because of you, the people of Minneapolis and of Minnesota. Back in the spring of 1952, I was scrutinizing prayerfully my duties and responsibilities, trying to resolve my doubts as to whether there was any place or need for me in politics, and to settle in my mind and my conscience what I ought to do. At that time, the write-in vote in the Minnesota primary moved me far along the road to a final decision. Since that day, I have always felt a special kinship and relationship with you of this city and state."
7.86628700258436e-05,0.999921337129974,1426_12,0,"Eventually, as in the satellites today, the cost proves greater to a once proud and independent people than the value of the monuments or the factories or the prisons that have been erected. In those lands, the fruits of imperialism are discontent, unrest, riots in one place and demonstrations in another, until the tyranny exercised over them either dissolves or is expelled. The day of liberation may be postponed where armed forces for a time make protest suicidal. But all history testifies that the memory of freedom is not erased by the fear of guns, and the love of freedom is more enduring than the power of tyrants. But it is necessary that the inspiration of freedom, and the benefits enjoyed by those who possess it, are known to those oppressed."
4.99881732710368e-05,0.999950011826729,1435_7,0,"I might apply this principle for you to the problem of civil rights. We believe, with the Constitution, in the equality before the law of every single American. In making this a reality in this day and time, we believe in cooperation. We believe that in getting the cooperation that comes about from willing working together of Americans, you achieve much more than you do just by writing a hard and fixed dictum of law and say everybody must conform."
5.2893736314864e-05,0.999947106263685,1459_3,0,"Third, we must get on with reclamation and basinwide development across the United States. Fourth, we must appoint a Federal Power Commission that represents the public interest and not the private interest. Therefore, in the 1960s we need a whole new concept of resource development. So vast, so complex, and so essential are our natural resources that they cannot be parceled out piecemeal; nothing less than a comprehensive, basin-by-basin, valley-by-valley development of our natural resources, to make sure that not one drop of our water goes from the wellsprings of our water to the sea without being used for a public purpose."
5.00309754576623e-05,0.999949969024543,1560_0,0,"I understand that Daniel Webster used to address 100,000 people without any trouble at all, and without a mike, so it should be easy for us.  We are a little softer than they used to be. I want to thank you very much for a generous reception.  I am particularly proud that I am associated on the ticket here in Minnesota with your distinguished congressman who has served this district and served the country, Joe Karth, whom I know you are going to send back to the House of Representatives and with your great governor, Orville Freeman, who was generous enough to nominate me at the convention.  But that is not the reason you ought to reelect him.  The reason you ought to reelect him is because he has served this state, and I don't know of a more difficult job in the United States than to be governor of an expanding atate with problems of education, taking care of our older people, the mentally retarded and all the rest.  I think Orville Freeman has moved forward with courage.  I am confident that this State is going to respond to that kind of leadership. "
5.04079926477337e-05,0.999949592007352,1585_1,0,"I don't believe this country can afford another recession.  The demands placed upon us are too great.  Every time that we fail to meet our problems, every time that we fail to move our economy forward, we fail not only our own people, but we fail all those who look to us for leadership.  My judgment is that there is a very clear choice between the Republican and the Democratic parties.  They stand for different things, and they have stood for different things all through this century.  Woodrow Wilson, running in 1912, said that the Republican party idea of policy is to sit on the lid.  Franklin Roosevelt carried the fight in 1932 and 1936 and Harry Truman carried the fight in 1948, and on the issues which matter, housing, social security, medical care for the aged, minimum wage, development of the resources of this country, I believe the Democratic party looks forward.  I believe it has presented to this country programs which move the economy of this country."
5.22710324065166e-05,0.999947728967593,1588_10,0,"Only a third of the homes in the island even had running water, and in the years which preceded the Castro revolution this abysmal standard of living was driven still lower as population expansion outdistanced economic growth. Only ninety miles away stood the United States--their good neighbor--the richest nation on earth--its radios and newspapers and movies spreading the story of America's material wealth and surplus crops. But instead of holding out a helping hand of friendship to the desperate people of Cuba, nearly all our aid was in the form of weapons assistance--assistance which merely strengthened the Batista dictatorship--assistance which completely failed to advance the economic welfare of the Cuban people--assistance which enabled Castro and the Communists to encourage the growing belief that America was indifferent to Cuban aspirations for a decent life."
5.53629725074863e-05,0.999944637027493,1588_5,0,"Exploiting the twin themes of human misery and Yankee hatred, Castro's campaign has met with success in almost every country - in Brazil, where both presidential candidates found it politically expedient to appeal to pro-Castro and anti-American elements in the electorate - in Mexico, where anti-American riots followed pressure on a pro-Castro spokesman - in Guatemala, where Castro-equipped revolutionaries are a real menace - in Uruguay, where a general strike was threatened if Castro was not supported at the San Jose Conference.  And--at the same foreign ministers' conference--the United States suffered one of its few diplomatic defeats in the history of inter-American relations, when it was forced to withdraw its protest over Communist efforts in this hemisphere. This is a critical situation--to find so dangerous an enemy on our very doorstep.  The American people want to know how this was permitted to happen--how the Iron Curtain could have advanced almost to our front yard.  They want to know the truth--and I believe that they are entitled to the truth.  It is not enough to blame it on unknown state department personnel.  Major policy on issues such as Cuban security is made at the highest levels--in the national Security Council and elsewhere--and it is the party in power which must accept full responsibility for this disaster."
5.12451638262975e-05,0.999948754836174,1610_1,0,"The next presidential candidate to come here was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. Three times during this century the Democratic party has elected presidents, one was Woodrow Wilson, number two was Franklin Roosevelt, and number three was president Truman in 1948.  On many different occasions the other party has elected Presidents, Mr. McKinley, Mr. Harding, Mr. Coolidge.  They ran Mr. Landon.  They ran Mr. Dewey.  And we come to 1960.  I believe that parties are important.  I believe that the kind of men that parties pick are important.  I believe that the party label tells us something about the candidate, something about the things for which they stand, something of their political philosophy.  And I stand here with some pride and satisfaction as the direct successor to the Democratic presidents who in this century carried the banner of the new freedom, the New Deal and the Fair Deal."
5.22049273564994e-05,0.999947795072643,1628_6,0,"Now, this decline is continuing, and the program that Mr. Nixon has put forward in my opinion will provide for a further decline in farm income, because he provides the same program that Mr. Benson provides, which is a support price for corn or wheat, soybeans, whatever it may be, which is tied to 90 percent of the average market price for the three previous years.  Now, as the market price drops so drops the support price.  Where you had $1.50 for corn eight years ago, you may be getting 90 cents for corn today, or 93 cents.  That is the market price.  Mr. Nixon will pay you 90 percent of that market price next year, and if it drops to 85 cents, he will pay you 90 percent of that, and that is the step, down, down, down, until farmers are driven off their farms in increasing numbers."

Mr. Nixon could not run on the program that he runs on if he recognized our times.  He could not run on the program that our power and prestige is at its height, that of the communists at the lowest it has been, that everything is all right and being done in its proper measure.  The very fact that he chooses that as his campaign indicates that he could not suddenly reverse in 1961 and determine on action.  If he really believes these things he says, in my opinion he disqualifies himself.  If he does not believe them, and runs on that program, he makes the same mistake that Stanley Baldwin made in England in 1935 which almost destroyed Great Britain, by misleading the people of England in 1935.  He prevented them, by not telling them the truth, he prevented them from arming at a time when it might have been possible to prevent the disaster of Munich."

And to accomplish these things, we will develop to the fullest the untapped natural resources our water, our minerals, our power with which we are so fortunate to be blessed in this rich land of ours. And we shall provide for our scientists, the support they need for the research that will open exciting new highways into the future--new highways in which we shall have progress which we cannot even dream of today.

First of all, let's recognize a fundamental fact. You hear a lot of talk about the farm problem these days, and from a political standpoint it's a difficult one. But let's never forget that there is no greater asset that we have in our struggle with the forces of slavery than the tremendous incredible productivity of America's farmers. Mr. Khrushchev knows this. He told me when he got back to Washington that he was pretty impressed with what he saw on the farms in Iowa that he visited, and he has reason to know it and I'll tell you why: because here in the United States approximately 6.5 million farmers and farmworkers produce as much as 50 million farmers and farmworkers produce in the Soviet Union. That, you see, gives us a tremendous advantage which we must retain. But since we owe this to our farmers, we must see that our farmers get what they do not receive today, and that is a fair share of America's increasing prosperity, and this can be done. The problem is difficult. As I've indicated, I'm going to touch upon it in detail in Iowa on Friday and a speech in South Dakota at the national plowing contest the next night."

What I want to do today is to talk over with you some of my views based on this serious study. At the outset I would like this point clearly understood: the problems of farm people ought not be approached, as far too often has been the case in the past, as something to exploit for political advantage.  Rather, the approach has got to be objective, and has got to be constructive.  In a determined effort to find a solution, the good of the farmer, not the good of politicians, has to be our steady purpose if we are ever to get anywhere."

The thing that ran through my mind I'm sure was what would run through your mind--that the most important question and the most important responsibility for the next president of the United States is to see that those boys and thousands like them are always in uniforms of peace and never have to be in uniforms of war. And so I say to you today that the most important responsibility of the next president is to keep the peace without surrender and that is the question you should ask--which of the candidates--which of the two for president and vice president will best provide that leadership.

I'll tell you why.  Because we know him.  We know the Communists.  We sat opposite the table with them.  We know what they're trying to do.  Here are fanatical, ruthless men who are determined to conquer the world, determined to conquer it by any means, if necessary.  But when we consider them, then, we've got to recognize that they're going to cause us trouble--they're going to cause us trouble every time they can.

And let me say to every housewife here: if you vote for our opponents, the prices of everything you buy in the grocery store will go up because of their farm program, incidentally, that won't help the farmer either; but it will certainly have that effect, and they know it.

The federal government, with its ability to raise funds on a national basis, should aim at reducing the discrepancies among the various states in their resources for the support of education.

This does not necessarily mean there will be war. It does mean that the diplomacy requirements of the United States must be infinitely greater if we are to avoid it. Because what has kept the peace for the last twenty-five years has been the immense superiority that the United States has.

And now we read on yesterday that these grain speculators want to crawl through an unjustified loophole in the tax law known as the Disc System that would exempt 50% of these windfall profits from any tax at all. I want to say here that these fellows are not grain sharks--they are hogs. They want it all.

Last month, I offered a comprehensive economic program geared at reducing the growth in federal spending, in taxes, in regulation, and in the money supply, and restoring predictability and stability to economic policy. These are steps this administration has utterly refused to take, but they will form the foundation of the Reagan-Bush economic plan.

The average teacher in America today starts at about $14,000 or $13,000 a year.  In some states it's far less.  I was in Florida a year ago, and I saw a teacher's schedule that showed a teacher who had twenty years of teaching with a doctorate degree made $17,000 a year.  I may be off a couple thousand, but I remember being shocked by the figure.  I have talked to any number of young people who went into teaching full of hope and found out they just couldn't stick with it, couldn't afford it.  I talked to a young man in New Hampshire.  I don't think he voted for me based on the returns, but we had a nice conversation.  He told me that, more than anything, he wanted to be a science teacher.  But he had a family of two kids, he was now thirty-six years of age.  He said, I couldn't do it.  I had to get out.  And I made double or triple whatever it was in the private sector.  What is happening today is that a lot of young, skilled people are not going into education.  The tests show that a disproportionate number are testing at the lowest levels of skills and aptitudes.  That doesn't mean a lot of them won't become good teachers.  We ought to have a society in which both in terms of the environment of teaching being honored as a profession and the pay, is such that the very best, the top of each class, goes into education.  I think last year--as I recall, in Los Angeles--I believe I was told that a beginning teacher there made $13,000 and a beginning policeman $28,000.  I don't begrudge the policeman's salary at all.  But we're saying something about teaching when we give it this low status, and, of course, our kids will pay and our nation will pay.  By now we should know that it is the product of the trained mind that is the greatest source of wealth in America.  It's more important than all of our national resources, everything.  That's from an economic standpoint.  But education, of course--that's why I use the word learning--goes to the basis of our democracy, to our personal enrichment and fulfillment, of our understanding of this ever more dangerous world in which we live.  Education does everything that we need.  And it all begins with what goes on in that classroom.  If it's not effective, if we don't have the best teaching, it's not going to work.  As president, I intend to put a tremendous amount of attention on this.  I've spent a lot of my life in it.

You should be proud of the vote you cast for whatever office, for whatever office. And these things do matter to our citizens, particularly young people, who can only make informed choices in an election when there is some connection between the rhetoric and the reality between words and action, between promise and performance. And I think in this case, in this administration, that connection was broken a long time ago."

Ours is 7 percent. There will be no cuts in Medicare and no senior is going to be forced off Medicare. We wanted to balance the budget and increase Medicare and Bill Clinton vetoed it.

That a crowd this size--there are probably a lot of husbands and wives here--both are working; one to pay the bills for the family, the other to pay the taxes, which are now the highest in history, about 40 percent of what you earn goes for taxes.

I use me too in the grammatical, not the political sense. Which reminds me that there was a big meeting out here yesterday--a sort of bipartisan gathering with representatives from both branches of the Republican party. I don't know how the peace conference got along but they had a good time criticizing us for everything, as usual. They even accused me of the crime of visiting President Truman the other day--a crime that hasn't been committed since Rutherford B. Hayes, because the party in power has not nominated a candidate who was neither a member of Congress nor the Cabinet in seventy-five years. I thought I detected an explanation of their difficulty in finding something to say, however, when the orator of the day, Senator Nixon, revealed that out at the camp in Colorado, General Eisenhower's vacation headquarters, they ate fried mush most of the time.

It is help of this kind that we can provide by sending agricultural experts, engineers and other trained people to these countries, and through programs of assistance for economic development. By working with each country to expand the production of goods which are needed by other countries in the region, a self-generating and self-financing cycle of trade and development can be initiated, which will reduce and can eventually eliminate the need for American aid. At the same time, we can enlarge or export markets and develop new sources of the products we need to import."

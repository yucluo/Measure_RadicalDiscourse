4.11450892417002e-05,0.999958854910758,1023_2,0,"My heart is very much in these programs because whenever you travel through this great land of ours, you can't help but see how much these programs have meant to so many people. Above all, our Democratic platform calls for action on the overshadowing problems of war and peace--the most important unfinished business of our generation--and I mean steady resistance to Communism and patient and persistent efforts to build a peace which has been man's dearest goal from time immemorial. Now, in these few words--if these were all that you knew about me and about our Democratic platform, well, I will have to confess that you wouldn't know very much for it is easy to get up here on a campaign train and say some nice sounding words, but out of our party you get a lot more than some high sounding words--you get first of all the record of twenty years of solid accomplishment, of accomplishment in the interests of all our people, and I hope you will compare this record with the Republican record before you vote--for, by the way, they have a record too during these past twenty years, and it is easy to sum up that record. Whenever there has been a forward looking, a constructive program to oppose, they have opposed it, and that is about all their record amounts to."
4.08893531539729e-05,0.999959110646846,1040_8,0,"You know, they used to say in Washington in the early days of the war that you were likely to contract one of three diseases--either ulcers, galloping frustration, or a sense of humor. I have never felt better; I feel frustrated only by the difficulty I have had in engaging in any genuine debate with the Republicans; and, as far as my sense of humor is concerned, I hope it is intact. And I hope the time will never come when the Republican party gets into office and forbids any humor in political campaigns."
4.37639288803331e-05,0.99995623607112,1043_11,0,"There has been loose talk of a war of liberation to free the enslaved peoples of Eastern Europe. Such a war is unthinkable and would destroy the very people and the civilization that we seek to save. Yet the day of liberation will come, and there is much we can do in the meantime to help the unhappy people of Eastern Europe. Through the United Nations much is being done to rally the conscience of mankind. We can offer help and encouragement to those thousands of families and those individuals who are escaping, month by month, through the chinks in the Iron Curtain."
4.00203516695737e-05,0.999959979648331,1047_1,0,"There is some very important business before our nation, as you all know, and it encourages me to think that these many groups we see all the time have a strong feeling we had better leave the management of our affairs in the hands of the Democratic party. And one reason for this is that it has become harder and harder instead of easier and easier to tell precisely what the Republican party stands for in this campaign. I confess it is early in the morning to be harsh about anybody and to be very critical of anybody. I don't want to be critical or harsh. I have in mind that we are now only a week from our election and we still don't know precisely what the Republicans propose to do about much of anything. We know where they stand on the matter of a new labor relations law, for example. That is precisely where they stood for the past five years. That is an old Republican position."
4.47684868473584e-05,0.999955231513152,1073_22,0,"Greece and Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean were saved by prompt action by President Truman and the Congress and they were saved in spite of the blind obstruction of the Old Guard Republicans. Who gave us the Marshall Plan which prevented the Kremlin's bloodless conquest of Western Europe? Who faced up to the Russians in Berlin when they tried to strangle and seize that city? Who insisted on the heroic airlift and who was it that hammered out the North Atlantic Alliance, which banded together the free people of Europe in a united defense against Communist aggression?"
4.11772568587032e-05,0.999958822743141,1076_4,0,"     We are not only, as I say, a moral country.  This is a brave and a generous country, I think we are bearing our responsibilities well as the strong leader of the free nations against the threat of Soviet communism.  We are doing the hard job that must be done if we are to have a secure place for ourselves and for those children.  We are following out the high ideals of Woodrow Wilson, who wanted to take us our full part--give us our full part--accept our full responsibility for securing the peace back in 1920 after the first World War.  The American people didn't listen to Wilson in those days.  We turned instead to people who led us away from the hard road of international cooperation to the easy  path of isolation.  If we had listened to him we might well have avoided the terrible trial of the second World War, in which 300,000 of our young men died."
4.21151928606153e-05,0.999957884807139,1091_22,0,"There is a whole lot you and I can do about this on Election Day, November 4th. We can make sure that the whole atmosphere of our government is one of common honesty. With honesty, we will have competence. We will set an example of industry and integrity which will again make free government the shining object of admiration and respect throughout the world."
4.08807559841787e-05,0.999959119244016,1114_3,0,"So, in all of our problems of the preservation of Constitutional forms, in the determination that Communism shall not take over our government, in the determination that Communism abroad shall not present to us an unbearable threat, let us remember this:  We are first of all defending the basic tenets of our Constitutional government that each man is a spiritual being created in the image of his God. Once we have gotten that thought in our minds so that we never forget it, ladies and gentlemen, we can clean out corruption.  Why, think of it, think of the votes we can roll up on November 4th.  We can bring down taxes; we can stop the terrific taxes that are piling up your prices.  An economist came into me the other day, one of these fellows, you know, that dig out the facts.  Every time you eat a boiled egg, unless you raise it yourself, you pay 100 taxes on that egg, one hundred taxes and then we wonder where the prices come from."
4.18259563841319e-05,0.999958174043616,1127_31,0,"I will not support any amendments which weaken the rights of working men and women.  In seeking desirable amendments, I will ask the advice and suggestions of all groups--public, management, and labor.  And, gentlemen, I assure you that this invitation of mine will be genuine and in good faith.  It will not be one of those empty theatrical gestures so often made in recent years.  In my own mind I have complete confidence that this job of amending the law can be worked out so that no fair-minded member of your group will consider the results unreasonable.  No such legislation must ever be regarded as final, and in considering amendments to labor legislation, labor will have an equal voice.  It is the American way to take what we have and constantly seek to make it better."
4.41093878319343e-05,0.999955890612168,1130_24,0,"Next, I want to see maintained the Constitutional relationship between the federal and the state governments.  My oath of office would demand that.  My convictions would require it.   The federal government did not create the states in this republic.  The states created the federal government.  The creation should not supersede the creator."
3.93824504030547e-05,0.999960617549598,1137_6,0,"Much of my life in the service of my country I have been forced to spend abroad.  It does one thing for you, ladies and gentlemen.  It makes certain that every time you come back you think more of this country.  If there is any veteran in this whole crowd who didn't have that same feeling when he came stemming into New York or San Francisco or Seattle or Norfolk, then I would be astonished because I have never yet met one who has not said, Well, one good thing a tour abroad does for you; it makes you understand how well worthwhile it is working here at home."
4.24311050943286e-05,0.999957568894906,1144_31,0,"These differences, ladies and gentlemen, are the issues of this campaign.  They are not issues to be taken lightly, or lightly treated.  They are serious for every American.  That is the way I shall continue to treat them.  Especially are these problems serious for what we oldsters call the younger generation.  Young people with their idealism, their faith and their hopes must have a fair chance to shape the nation which will be theirs."
4.18094066901725e-05,0.99995819059331,1181_9,0,"Ladies and gentlemen, my train was late, our time is short, but you have met a part of the Michigan team--Michigan members that must be on this great team to help in cleaning out the Washington mess.  Your governor, your new Senator, your Congressman--we must have them all--and with them and on behalf of all Republicans, I make these pledges to labor, to farmers, to businessmen, to every American:  first, if you want to change administrations this fall, if you want the group that the Republicans can put in the administration and in the Senate and in the House to take charge of this thing--clean it out and start us on a different road than we are now following--then they promise this:  There will be fairness, decency and justice prevailing in that administration, and they will serve you honestly as your servants and will not attempt to be your master.  That is the first pledge they make."
4.00507424262336e-05,0.999959949257574,1197_13,0,"In Omaha the statements made in the Kasson speech in Minnesota were extended.  It is in the record as to what the Republican Party expects to do, purposes to do, with price supports, with REA, with cooperatives, with all of those things that mean so much to farm life today.  And that means perishable products as well as nonperishables.  So all of this talk about the Republican Party trying to put the farmer in the poor house is about as weak an argument as they could develop.  They say we want to abolish good times, that everybody will be out with a tin cup on the bread lines.  I made a talk the other night at Peoria where I took to pieces this so-called Democrat prosperity to show that the only advance in living standards the American people have made in the last 20 years was during the five years of World War II.  I do not believe that America wants a prosperity that is based upon the risks and sacrifices that men have to make in uniform against an enemy."
4.25776339226403e-05,0.999957422366077,1220_4,0,"Just north of where we are gathered tonight passes a historic line that encircles the globe.  This line is invisible in America, but in another land it is traced in blood.  It is the 38th parallel, the line which divides North and South Korea."
4.07522288716425e-05,0.999959247771129,1234_0,0,"Governor Barrett, I see there are some people around here who have the right idea. The first thing I find is a wash-rag and it says, Clean up with Ike. I have got, of course, many, many reasons for being pleased when I get out into this country.  Ever since 1919, friends of mine have been asking me out to fish and hunt, and it has been a grand country, but of course, I don't much chance, so I spend a great deal of time reading western stories.  One of the first ones I ever read was written right around here in this country.  I think it was written in Medicine Bow, Owen Wister's The Virginian."
3.92384034207171e-05,0.999960761596579,1280_3,0,"We have got to get dedicated men and women from all over this United States who have been living closer to the people, who have not grown arrogant by being too long in power, who have not gotten too complacent or indifferent or think they can sell any bill of goods of fear and despair to America and so secure its votes. Now, if we are going to have a fresh start on this thing, we have got to have a complete change in the political complexion in Washington.  I picked up this morning a little clipping.  I am going to read to you just two sentences:  In South Bend, Indiana, yesterday, someone from the crowd addressed by the Democratic candidate, the administration's hand-picked candidate, shouted this question, Would you fire Acheson?   And it says here, Dean Acheson, the Secretary of State, and the answer was this, I will answer questions like that after the election, the Governor replied.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is the only answer the poor man could make.  He has the record, this sorry record of the last seven years to defend, and here is one he can't defend; but he can't on the other hand, say in advance, I repudiate that record and the people who have made it.  But I say, this crusade in which I am engaged does repudiate that record of error, and we are ready to replace from top to bottom.  No one has anything but admiration for the great body of public servants of America who are contained in the civil service and in the uniformed services.  We are talking, in this top to bottom clean-out, about these political appointees, the policy-makers, if you please, of our country--and not only in domestic policy but in this foreign field."
4.25254904214705e-05,0.999957474509579,1295_12,0,"Those days must not return.  They will not return.  To prevent their return, I pledge to enlist all the resources of private industry and mobilize all the resources of our government to prevent the specter of mass unemployment for once again visiting our land."
4.06507099496036e-05,0.999959349290051,1304_4,0,"Just one or two items that are in this program of fear, and I will be on my hasty way through this section of New York state. They fear, they say, that these Republican, Independent and enlightened Democratic friends of mine will bring on a depression; that we may be able to lead the country toward peace, but if we do, there will be no jobs, men will be out of work, there will be breadlines--all that sort of bunk.  Now, the first thing that is necessary to lead our country toward peace is a strong America; and the first thing that means a strong America is an employed America--a prosperous America--that stands as an example of what free government can do for its citizens in this world.  That is the purpose to which this crusade is dedicated."
4.13552302204596e-05,0.99995864476978,1309_5,0,"Then they began to fear that my associates and I would bring about a depression, that we would like suddenly to see the United States broke, go into an economic collapse.  But it happens that we have been the ones who are preaching that the greater fear and the threat of our time is Communism, and the only way to fight Communism is with a prosperous America--an America that is fully employed, with working men and women at good jobs with good pay, with farmers prosperous.  We preached that and taught it and carried it everywhere.  So they had to abandon that."
4.32404139934869e-05,0.999956759586006,1313_9,0,"Every single member in this crusade is pledged to this idea: That at the first sign of any approaching depression, the full power of private industry, of local and state government, and all resources of federal government will be mobilized to see that never again will we have mass unemployment.  We are committed to the expansion and improvement of social security programs, particularly to saving what is left of our dollars so that your insurance policies, your old age insurance, your unemployment insurance and the rest of itdon't run out of your pocket through that big hole they call inflation.  Unless we stop that, there is no hope."
3.97157589289922e-05,0.999960284241071,1318_14,0,"Don't misunderstand me. I, for one, am ready to acknowledge the sincerity of the Republican President's desire for peace and happiness for all. But good intentions are not good enough and the country is stalled on dead center--stalled in the middle of the road--while the world goes whirling by. America, which has lifted man to his highest economic state, which has saved freedom in war and peace, which saved collective security, no longer sparks and flames and gives off new ideas and initiatives. Our lights are dimmed. We chat complacently of this and that while, in Carlyle's phrase, Death and eternity sit glaring. And I could add that opportunity, neglected opportunity, sits glaring too!"
4.05008849161064e-05,0.999959499115084,1326_13,0,"Even more is it true that our hopes for peace in the world are still far from realization, the ultimate peace far from being won. I said earlier this week at the American Legion Convention in Los Angeles that: There is not peace--the peace we seek--while our sons and brothers are still being drafted for two years of military service, their schooling interrupted, their normal lives postponed."
4.06887571518121e-05,0.999959311242848,1335_23,0,"The Republican congressman from this very district, Mr. Hyde, said of the classroom problem, There is not a state in this Union which cannot afford to take care of that need. Another Republican congressman suggested that classes were too small and that they should go into the evening and run twelve months of the year. And, though President Eisenhower was nominally in favor of aid to education, this particular congressman on April 12, 1956, read into the Record a letter from the President in which Mr. Eisenhower said, I would flatly oppose any grant by the federal government to all states in the Union for educational purposes. I am perplexed to say the least, but contradiction--unilateral as well as multilateral--seems to be about the only entertainment these Republicans have contrived."
4.16918932079173e-05,0.999958308106792,1343_10,0,"When the Democrats were in power, the conservation and development of our natural resources was treated as a matter of current boards, if they survived at all. The projects that have been built are monuments to the hard and persistent work of your representatives in Congress, of men like John McClellan and Bill Fulbright and the members of your House delegation. But they have succeeded only when the climate was right--that is, when your senators and congressmen had the sympathetic support of a Democratic administration instead of determined Republican opposition."
4.35292184792806e-05,0.999956470781521,1347_21,0,"The magazines and newspapers, which denounce government intervention most lustily, are all subsidized by the U.S. Post Office--but that is not, it seems, legalized or even creeping socialism. Nor do airlines, for example, complain of the assistance they get as mail carrier. The private power companies--surely among the most active critics of governmental activity--have no objection to the billions of dollars worth of government financed and directed research, experiment, and pioneer construction which is being made available free to the private builders of atomic power plants. Nor has any private company blushingly returned its tax write-offs for accelerated plant construction on the grounds that it is robbing the citizens of their tax money."
4.00067863634222e-05,0.999959993213637,1349_8,0,"And I urge you to send a good man to represent the people of Indianapolis to the U.S. Congress, James Carvey. I want to say another word about the farmer. I don't need to tell you people here in Indiana what's happened to Candidate Eisenhower's promise to farmers four years ago--or what's happened to the farmer and the family farm. But I assumed a duty at the National Plowing Match at Newton, Iowa, last week that I want to perform here today."
4.20028077858411e-05,0.999957997192214,1357_16,0,"The most obvious weakness, of course, is the ease with which our national forests, our wildlife refuges, our parks and streams, and public lands have been invaded and turned to selfish private purpose. But more important even than that, perhaps, is the shunting aside of men who are experienced and trained in a lifetime of conservation work, in favor of politician appointees. The agency that looked at tomorrow's needs for minerals has been disbanded--and nothing put in its place. The Soil Conservation Service has been weakened--and must be revived. We need the leadership that will look at the nation's needs for water, for areas of recreation in the great open country, for land, and forest, and streams. We need, in other words really to look together at the needs and resources of our common future."
3.9266253175732e-05,0.999960733746825,1377_5,0,"At Peoria, four years later, the President told his Republican audience that what he meant at Kasson, was that farmers should get their parity in the marketplace. If that means anything, it means they should get parity without price supports. And if that is what Mr. Eisenhower meant, why didn't he say so four years ago? He didn't say so because he knew that any such statement would have cost him."
4.62527552330806e-05,0.999953747244767,1378_35,0,What does Mr. Eisenhower propose then? That we go ahead with the development of the cobalt bomb to try to gain another advantage? A force that can shake the earth's axis.
4.09180429562496e-05,0.999959081957044,1385_13,0,"Either the President and the Vice President did not know how serious the situation was in the Middle East, or they did not want the American people to know--at least, till after the election. And only last Sunday--just four years ago--Mr. Dulles said in a television interview that the United States, Britain, and France have developed a common policy, and I think it's amazing the degree to which we have had a common policy... and the fact that there are certain minor superficial difficulties as to details about just how you handle tolls, or how much is going to get paid to Egypt and how much isn't, doesn't detract from the fact that we have a common policy. The superficial difficulties of Sunday became pretty formidable by Tuesday, when Britain and France broke with the United States in the U.N."
9.89088560672173e-05,0.999901091143933,1388_7,0,"We badly need to get down to fundamentals. The first is that whatever the provocation, aggression can no longer be tolerated in the atomic age. This has been our position always. We welcome the U.N. resolution as expressing the sense of the world community on this point, and we all hope that a cease-fire can be promptly arranged."
4.0556772426209e-05,0.999959443227574,1417_1,0,"I should tell you that, in a very real sense, I am here today as president because of you, the people of Minneapolis and of Minnesota. Back in the spring of 1952, I was scrutinizing prayerfully my duties and responsibilities, trying to resolve my doubts as to whether there was any place or need for me in politics, and to settle in my mind and my conscience what I ought to do. At that time, the write-in vote in the Minnesota primary moved me far along the road to a final decision. Since that day, I have always felt a special kinship and relationship with you of this city and state."
4.30273203255964e-05,0.999956972679674,1417_24,0,"Yet in our labor toward the peace we seek, we must comprehend always its basic requirements and face up to them manfully. First: strength--spiritual, intellectual, economic and military strength. Second: unity--our clear awareness that the road to peace is one that all nations must travel together, else none can do so. Third: faith--a faith in the greatness of our purpose that inspires in all of us a readiness to work and to sacrifice that this greatest of all mankind's hopes may one day be realized."
4.19138191585654e-05,0.999958086180842,1430_10,0,"This, I maintain, is the difference between us. Now, through these past four years, there has been one subject that this administration has lived with, worked with, done more with, than any other and that is trying to develop and build the road to peace. Without peace, we cannot have these things that we have been enjoying the past four years.  We cannot have lowered taxes, we cannot have prosperity, we cannot have confidence among ourselves."

That was a pledge I meant to keep. I am keeping it here now. I can assure you that I will keep all the other commitments that we make in this campaign."
4.18793787811504e-05,0.999958120621219,1462_0,0,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Mayor, Congressman Moss, Governor Brown: I want to express my appreciation to all of you for your kindness in coming down here and welcoming us.  This train is headed not only south, but it is headed toward Washington.  I think in many ways the election of 1960 comes at a time more dangerous for our country, more trying for all of us, a period of greater responsibility for every citizen than any election since the election of 1860.  In that time, as you recall, the great issue was whether this country could stay united, whether it would, in the words of Lincoln, exist half slave and half free.  The issue in the election of 1960 involves not only the well-being of the people of this valley, involves not only the development of your natural resources, but as citizens of the United States and leaders of the free world, we must be concerned about such far-off places as the Congo, India, and Indonesia, the security of those countries, as well as the well-being of their people.  "
4.16756151454805e-05,0.999958324384854,1497_1,0,"Many of us are government employees. I have a different office in Washington than you who work here in the city of Trenton, but I think that all of us who work for the government in one service or another, or all of us who work in other capacities, have a great and common interest in this campaign, and that is the advancement of the interest of the United States--to increase its power and prestige; to make it more secure; to make it possible in a dangerous world, when hazard surrounds us on every side, to make it possible for us to move safely ahead in a world of peace, protecting not only the security of the United States, but holding out the hand of friendship to all those who wish to be associated with us. Other Democratic presidents in this country--Woodrow Wilson, who served in this city, in this state, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman--all faced difficult and dangerous times. The election of 1932, I think, meant the preservation of freedom here in the United States. But I think the election of 1960 may well mean the preservation of freedom all around the globe."
4.08527351367518e-05,0.999959147264864,1520_11,0,"Fourth, around the world, when we and the Soviet Union are engaged in a great competition to see whether the world will be free or slave, we continue to persist in regarding the production of food from the ground as a problem, as a surplus, as a burden, when it is a blessing from the Lord. I think we need an administration which so regards it. We spend $42 billion on defense every year. Those ships sail the oceans. They protect us but they do not serve our people and the world. I do not regard the distribution of food around the world as a great burden upon us. I regard it as an opportunity, to use our assets in a way which will attract people to the cause of freedom. I am glad that this is our problem, and not starvation. I am glad we can produce more than we can consume, if we share it usefully, for we are our brother's keeper; and if we have great assets in this country, I believe we should hold out the hand of friendship. When hundreds of millions of people stagger through their lives searching for food and we have it, and we are trying to determine which way the world will go, I would rather see our food used in an imaginative way than to argue in kitchens or anyplace else. I want to help people and I want the United States to be identified with that cause as it was in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and Harry Truman."
3.92660472246649e-05,0.999960733952775,1573_5,0,"Mr. Nixon has said that when I say that some of these things could be better, that I am downgrading the United States.  I served it for 18 years.  I have the greatest confidence in the United States.  I am not satisfied to see it second best in any area of national and international life.  I want an America that is not first, if; not first, but; not first, when; but first, period, and I think we can do it.  I believe that this generation of Americans has the same rendezvous with destiny as that generation of Americans in 1936 to whom Franklin Roosevelt addressed those words, that that generation had a rendezvous with destiny.  I believe we do, too.  The rendezvous was the question of whether freedom could be maintained here in the United States.

There are 15 million American homes, according to the last Bureau of the Census, which are substandard.  Mr. Nixon has issued a paper on housing, and this, I think, is most revealing of all and one of the most endearing qualities of the Vice President.  In his position paper issued in New York within the last three weeks, he says that the Housing Act of 1949 has worked very well, and do you know as a congressman he voted against it?  In that position paper he called for greater emphasis on middle-income housing and he voted against that in 1950.  He calls for a greater flow of housing credit so that the American people can buy houses at low rates of interest.  But he neglects to mention his vote as vice president to increase the interest rates on the GI housing bans.  High interest rates never built a single home and one of the reasons why we are building 200,000 less homes each year than we should to keep up with our population increase is because of the high interest rate policy of this administration.

But what is the area of difference between us?  What is the issue on which you should base your decision?  You should not only make a judgment of Mr. Nixon and myself.  You should also make a judgment about yourselves, what you want, about what your view is of your country and your community, about what your view of the future is, whether you are satisfied today or wish to do better.  If you are satisfied, if you feel happy about your life, if you feel our country is meeting its responsibilities, then you belong in Mr. Nixon's camp.  But if you share the view that I hold very vigorously that this country is going to have to do better in the future, that we have responsibilities to meet not only to ourselves but to the cause of freedom, that we are anxious to make sure that in the future people decide that these days were great days in the life of our country, that we must move forward, we must stimulate our growth, we must hold out an image to the world of a vigorous, dynamic society, if we are going to continue to lead the free world--I believe that is the choice.

I don't think an administration which has presided over three recessions in the last eight years, which is now presiding over the lessening of the U.S. position around the world, which has permitted the U.S. image to fade as a vital society, our most important asset, which has in that way damaged the cause of freedom, I cannot believe that any young man or woman who looks to the future can possibly decide to sit down and sit still and look back with Mr. Nixon and the Republican party which has always opposed progress."

They are people who are determined to conquer the world and they will follow no rules of the game whatever, and this means, in other words, that we need, in order to deal with them, to develop the strength, we need to have the realism, which will effectively stop their plans and stop them without war."

I stand here talking of experience but most of all, I stand here to tell you that my colleague and I, knowing the men with whom we deal, know that we can never rest for a moment on our record, that we must move forward militarily.

We have a great humanitarian concern, and one of the reasons that we have developed this concern is because of the contribution made by people that make up the mainstream of American life.  Who are they?  They came from all the countries of the world.  Warm-hearted Italians, people from Europe, from Asia, from Africa, these are Americans.

And so, one, we will keep America strong militarily, and the second thing we will do is this.  We will be firm in our diplomacy.  We know this man as I emphasized.  We know that he doesn't react like the leaders of the free world.  We know that the naive and well-intentioned people who suggest that a concession here or a concession there will lead to peace forget the lessons of history.

We've been hearing that America has been standing still, and it's said we've got to change our economic policies so that America can get going again, so that we can cross some new frontiers.  Well, my friends just let me say this: Anybody who says America has been standing still during the Eisenhower years just hasn't been traveling around America.  He's been traveling in some other country, I can tell you that, because look at this area; look at the state of Florida, the growth here in the last eight years.

Such efforts toward personal security, first, are right--not only from the humanitarian viewpoint, which all of us will understand--they are mandatory if our complex modern society is to work at its best, at its fullest.  They are essential to our purpose.  And what is that purpose?  I think, summed up in a sentence, it is this: we must lift the ceiling over personal opportunity.  We must strengthen the floor over the pit of personal disaster.  Public policy, therefore, should seek to put right what is wrong in our America, but it should also seek to strengthen what is right.  It should recognize the plain fact that Americans are proud and self-reliant individuals.  Programs that encourage individuals to depend on government are wrong, for increasing dependence by a people upon government is not a sign of strength; it is a sign of weakness, and in this day of competition with the Communists, Americans must be sturdy and strong."

For nearly four decades we have marched together in this country for the same goal:  a safer, a better, a more prosperous and a freer America and Americans, an America of equal opportunity where every individual can say not in defiance but in pride, I am an American and I am a man and I am proud to be a citizen of this great country.  Yes, yes, we march, we marched for Franklin Roosevelt out of the dark days of the Depression when he said that all we had to fear was fear itself and we marched right on through that Depression and America went on to win a great victory not only over a Depression, but in World War II and we marched with Harry Truman, who told it just like it was and he did something about it, too, for all of us, and we marched and we marched with John F. Kennedy who stood before you eight years ago and said these words to you:  I would like it to be said that in our administration, our country moved, but special emphasis on education, took care of our children and gave medical care to the aged and that we ended discrimination of all kinds in the United States.  He said, and I say, we want fair treatment for all Americans.  that is the Democratic program.  And, my friends, we have been marching to that  music, to Democratic administrations, and we passed Medicare and more aid to education to help our children than any other administration in the history of this country and we passed more civil rights legislation and we have done more for our job training and more opportunity than any political party or any administration.  That's why we are proud to be Democrats.  And you can tell your grandchildren that you were there when America awoke from eight years of fitful sleep, the great GOP slumber, and moved forward once again under Kennedy, under Johnson, and now under Humphrey and Muskie.  Yes, Mr. Nixon says, and now listen to what he says, because really it's hard to understand what he says.  It's a little confusing.  Listen to what he says.  He says, If you elect Hubert Humphrey, it will be more of the same.  And you know, that fellow is beginning to tell the truth.  It's new Nixon when it comes to that.  And, by the way, friends, don't worry about the new one, don't even worry about the old one; what you've got to worry about is the real Nixon.  That's the one you got to worry about "

Are we going to be a divided nation, conflict and animosity and bitterness and violence?  Are we going to be a nation of people that can live together as friends and neighbors, rather than antagonists and enemies?  We have one candidate in this election who is an outright racist, and appeals on racial prejudice, and he is no friend of labor.  Any laboring man who can find a way to support the former governor of Alabama has little or no regard for the union movement.

I bet not 1 percent of the people in this room had ever heard my name. We began campaigning just like you would if you wanted to be president. My wife and I and my children and a few volunteers began going from one home to another. And we would invite all the neighbors to come into the living room and meet with us--sometimes three or four people would show up. We'd go into a labor hall that would hold up to two to three hundred folks, and maybe ten people would come, and we'd stand in factory shift lines, and nobody knew why I was there or who I was. And by the time I explained, I'm Jimmy Carter from Georgia, I'm running for president, they were already gone. We walked into beauty parlors and barber shops and restaurants, and on the streets and factory shift lines, later on, shopping centers, farmers' markets, livestock sales barns, city halls, county court houses. We talked a little. And we listened a lot. In New Hampshire and Florida, and Illinois and North Carolina, and all over the country. We had thirty primaries where you could win delegates. And I was in all of them. I didn't win them all. But because my base and my support was from the people, we built up a campaign organization that made history in presidential campaign politics in our country. Long before the convention even met, I had won the nomination of the Democratic party. Most of the delegates who went there for me had never been involved in politics before. But they believed in me and I believed in them, and I haven't changed.

When they were finished, they wouldn't even let the issue come up to a vote, in spite of the majority wanting to do something about these lawsuits."

We saw great sights today coming in here, rolling hills and golden cornfields, vivid proof of why our great nation is the most bountiful and special place on the face of the Earth.

Because we had the courage to stand for freedom, the world today now holds unprecedented opportunity. We've got to be ready for it.

The other side trusts the government. We trust the people who are here today. And I want Steve and John and Rob and Jim Bunning and all the--and Mike DeWine, of course, there next year to help me.

You should be proud of the vote you cast for whatever office, for whatever office. And these things do matter to our citizens, particularly young people, who can only make informed choices in an election when there is some connection between the rhetoric and the reality between words and action, between promise and performance.

This is the time when even the most obsolete Republican becomes momentarily reconciled to the machine age. He listens--he's very apt to listen with a stiff upper lip--while his candidate calls for those greater social gains which a few minutes before they called wild-eyed socialism. In this season Republican candidates are even forgiven for whispering that there could be a better law than the Taft-Hartley Act.

I don't think the tearful and interminable post-mortems about China will save any souls for democracy in the rest of Asia, the Near East, and in Africa. India is not caught up in civil strife. It can be helped in a way that is natural to us and best for it; help in the ways of peace and of social progress. India has to grow more food. It has to restore its land. It needs new resources of power. In short, it needs a democratic helping hand in the development programs it has already charted for itself."

Now, actually it doesn't make any difference whether it is Republican or Democratic rascality; a bad public servant is a bad apple and you throw out a bad apple whatever its variety. That is what I believe and I think that is what we are going to do at every level of our government, if the people are conscious enough of what their responsibility is. But rascals in government are only the uglier practices of wasters in government. Economy is just as important as honesty--for a taxpayer's dollar that is wasted is just as bad as a taxpayer's dollar that is stolen. And here again I lay what I hope is not an immodest claim to some hard and educational experience in making both ends of a government budget meet, in keeping a government lean and trimmed down to an efficient size. I have some idea about that; as the product of practical experience in Illinois, I have learned that economy in government isn't just something that you say you are going to have. You have to grind at it all of the time. You have to grind--everybody--up and down the ladder; the purchasing officers who spend millions of the taxpayers' money, the fellows who deal around in government orders, even the girls who want to use a fresh carbon every time they want to write a letter. It is the same old business day and night. You've got to live it yourself twenty-four hours a day."

Are these the men we want to lead our nation in the struggle against Communism today? All the while they proclaim ferocious anti-Communism. Indeed, the best way they can apparently find to obscure their retreat from the fight against Communism abroad, the fight to keep it distant from our shores, is by shouting and screaming every hour on the hour about how much they hate Communism at home."
5.97384569651675e-05,0.999940261543035,1037_2,0,"Now, you know, I wouldn't say, my friends, that this proves conclusively that the Old Guard Republicans are really Communists, but I suppose if I were an Old Guard Republican I would, because that is exactly the way they argue. The great transformation which has overtaken our country in these twenty years has come about, in great part, because we have had a new spirit and a new purpose in our government--you could almost feel the change from confusion to confidence, from fear to faith, when the election of 1932 produced a great new leader, Franklin Roosevelt. And that was only the beginning of the process by which America began to lift itself out of the depths, both economically and spiritually, and onto a new plane of social responsibility and of decency. Government assumed responsibilities to avert economic catastrophe and to assure reasonable levels of security for the people. By doing this, great new energies within the people were unlocked. Of course, this new activity on the part of government aroused resentment. The Old Guard began raising their tired old refrain of socialism, and regimentation; you have heard these cries against every new idea in American history since the post office and the public schools."
5.66821440562234e-05,0.999943317855944,1039_6,0,"I am frank to say we have had very little cooperation from some of the veteran's posts. They are awful keen about this law enforcement, but they continue to use all these devices in their own posts. So it is a little incongruous. They say, By gosh, we are going to clean up crime in this community and get those slot machines out of that corner saloon. But of course, as far as our Legion Post, or VFW, or whatever it is, that belongs to us and it is certainly a different situation. And after all, the device is set to give the fellow at least a sixty to a hundred chance of winning as against one chance in a hundred in the commercial device; and, after all, we own the machine, and it is not owned by a syndicate of operators and placed on a rental basis. And so on and so on."
5.57966599678344e-05,0.999944203340032,1047_1,0,"There is some very important business before our nation, as you all know, and it encourages me to think that these many groups we see all the time have a strong feeling we had better leave the management of our affairs in the hands of the Democratic party. And one reason for this is that it has become harder and harder instead of easier and easier to tell precisely what the Republican party stands for in this campaign. I confess it is early in the morning to be harsh about anybody and to be very critical of anybody. I don't want to be critical or harsh. I have in mind that we are now only a week from our election and we still don't know precisely what the Republicans propose to do about much of anything. We know where they stand on the matter of a new labor relations law, for example. That is precisely where they stood for the past five years. That is an old Republican position."
6.41769111941214e-05,0.999935823088805,1051_14,0,"I have been surprised to find that in some of the northern sections of the country there is a certain suspicion of Southerners. There is a provincial assumption--and fortunately not very widespread--that any man in public life in the South is bound to be a reactionary, or worse. If anyone can dispel this illusion, once and for all, John Sparkman is the man to do it."
6.11424606847162e-05,0.999938857539316,1067_14,0,"We must do nothing that might array class against class, or citizen against citizen, in quarrels which tear apart our blessed American family. I shall do all I can to sustain a feeling of mutual confidence and understanding among all segments of our society. I see the American people rejoicing in their strength and sure of their destiny--and I see them from coast to coast--and for such a brotherhood among our people, I think everything is possible. "
5.71913559281277e-05,0.999942808644072,1144_31,0,"These differences, ladies and gentlemen, are the issues of this campaign.  They are not issues to be taken lightly, or lightly treated.  They are serious for every American.  That is the way I shall continue to treat them.  Especially are these problems serious for what we oldsters call the younger generation.  Young people with their idealism, their faith and their hopes must have a fair chance to shape the nation which will be theirs."
5.71941920164544e-05,0.999942805807983,1146_2,0,"The British over on the left couldn't break out of the fortified town of Cannes, and we didn't know what we were going to do.  A little sergeant--Sergeant Kuhlen--I will never forget his name as long as I live--came up with an idea.  He found that he could put some knives on the front of our tanks that would go in and cut off these hedges.  The tanks could come through straight and come through shooting, and it wasn't very pleasant for the Germans. "
5.5125613433237e-05,0.999944874386567,1150_1,0,"I had a wonderful story told me about your town, that only last August in the midst of carrying on your fair you had a great storm that destroyed the buildings and tents and it looked like it was going to be disaster and no fair.  You people pitched in on your own.  You didn't even wait for a Washington bureaucrat to come down and do it.  You did it yourselves.  Moreover, I am told what you could expect in that little incident, that the elephant stayed on the job working until the last and the donkey played out--just too old, too tired."
5.34166761049866e-05,0.999946583323895,1155_3,0,"The policies they are now pursuing are destroying your insurance policies, your government bonds, your savings accounts and it is making it so that every day you must carry more money in your purse to the grocery store in order to get a decent basket of groceries.  If we do not stop that kind of thing, ladies and gentlemen, then America cannot be what it has been in the past.  We must have a solvent America, an America that lives within its means, yet so far have they gone with these spendthrift policies that the government itself says that last year every city family had to spend $400 more than that family could earn to pay for its shelter, its food, its clothing and other necessities in the family.  If that goes on, not only is this government going to be broke but all the families in it are going to be broke.  That is not America."
7.17557019677714e-05,0.999928244298032,1174_32,0,"The program I have outlined demands skilled and purposeful leadership. It demands harmony and understanding between the executive and legislative branches of our government. It will demand an end to what the Senate Preparedness Subcommittee has called abuse, misuse and disuse of power."
5.14332616927211e-05,0.999948566738307,1183_0,0,"Ladies and gentlemen: there is not much relationship between the military life that I led for forty-one years and the kind of campaigning that I am now doing, but every once in a while I am reminded of certain rules or maxims in habits from that life, and one of them was, Never allow yourself to be surprised.  I was told that the last stop at Grand Rapids, Now, this is where you say goodbye to Michigan.  And then as we came along, a couple of your finest salesmen from Kalamazoo said, We are going to slow up the train as you go through Kalamazoo and you wave at some people.  Then later they said, Now, we'll tell you what we want to do.  We'll stop there a second and you just go on out and say hello and go on with your work.  I'll tell you this; it's a funny kind of a slowing down and a funny kind of a way to a little neighborhood crowd.  I am completely flabbergasted and I am certainly honored."
5.31731314086805e-05,0.999946826868592,1184_6,0,"Now if you will permit me one local word before I ask Mrs. Eisenhower to come out to wave to you, it is this:  Just as Michigan State is known for this great football team, and of which I now have a memento, it is also known for one thing that I have preached far and wide--proper agricultural research.  I am glad to have been here to pay tribute to its progress and its record in that field. Now friends, thank you again for turning out.  Let me bring out the better half of the Eisenhower tribe."
5.68811381861688e-05,0.999943118861814,1193_16,0,"At a critical moment in World War II, we induced the Nazis to hold an entire army in reserve in the Calais area to meet an attack that they thought was coming but which we never intended to launch.  Measures to deceive them worked so effectively that they estimated our original strength in Europe at seventy-five divisions instead of the actual thirty-six. In the entire American record in Europe there is no single instance where the enemy gained essential information of our plans through the medium of spies or subversive agents."
5.06596180765121e-05,0.999949340381923,1197_12,0,"Then we are accused of wanting to abolish the farm program and the price support.  Well, some things are so false you don't know the right words to use, at least in polite society, for condemning them.  I went to Kasson and on behalf of Republican leaders, and with the concurrence of the great men of the party, at least all that could be reached in time, I stated exactly what we meant to do, and the present 90 percent parity price in the farm program was sustained and supported completely.  Moreover, we pledge that these programs in the future, as it comes time for them to be revised and brought up to date as all programs must be, it will be farmers that will be brought in to Washington whose counsel and advice will not only be sought but, it will be heed."
5.29205523576268e-05,0.999947079447643,1197_13,0,"In Omaha the statements made in the Kasson speech in Minnesota were extended.  It is in the record as to what the Republican Party expects to do, purposes to do, with price supports, with REA, with cooperatives, with all of those things that mean so much to farm life today.  And that means perishable products as well as nonperishables.  So all of this talk about the Republican Party trying to put the farmer in the poor house is about as weak an argument as they could develop.  They say we want to abolish good times, that everybody will be out with a tin cup on the bread lines.  I made a talk the other night at Peoria where I took to pieces this so-called Democrat prosperity to show that the only advance in living standards the American people have made in the last 20 years was during the five years of World War II.  I do not believe that America wants a prosperity that is based upon the risks and sacrifices that men have to make in uniform against an enemy."
6.30522049596684e-05,0.999936947795041,1216_17,0,"Now, of course, with the expenditure programs that are required today for necessary purposes, there cannot be any escape for the moment from high costs and high taxes and high prices.  Which makes it all the more necessary that we watch with a jaundiced eye anything that is unnecessary--all of the waste, the duplication, the inefficiency that we know about, and which you would not expect me here today at this time to enumerate.  That must be eliminated and it is the second purpose of this crusade."
5.58243354424877e-05,0.999944175664558,1220_40,0,"In this enterprise which I describe, we are not trying to remake the world in the image of America.  We are not trying to force any man to our way if it is not his.  We are not trying to buy peace or bring peace with the sword."
5.24918208236044e-05,0.999947508179176,1233_24,0,"The Republicans have not only participated in every one of our enlightened farm programs, protection of farmers against disasters where they can't protect themselves, but they have pledged this:  When it comes time in the future to begin to study these programs and how we adjust them to changing and future conditions, farmers will be brought in and farm leaders will be brought in.  They will be consulted, and not the way they are consulted now:  You do this or you will get no more.  They will be consulted on what is the problem of their locality.  We have no intention in this crusade of getting a bunch of long-haired Brannan experts to come out and run your farms.  We figure you can do it a little better."
5.12462389488024e-05,0.999948753761051,1246_8,0,"All of these costs and all of these expenditures would be bad enough if they were limited strictly to what they have to be, but when we have waste and carelessness piled on top of that, to the point where we are getting two airfields for the price of five, we simply cannot afford that luxury in this time of our history. Then, as if all of this were not enough, why do we have to have any vestige of subversion or dishonesty in our government--in high places and in low? Not long ago, a lady wrote me a letter.  She said, General, I should like to vote for you, but before I do will you promise me this:  That you will see that more of my tax money actually gets to Washington.  I wrote to her and said, My friend, a hard-working American taxpayer does not have to request that common woodshed honesty be observed by American officials in high positions.  That we can and should demand, and we don't have to ask for it."
5.07468691116754e-05,0.999949253130889,1300_38,0,"A: You know, fortunately, Mr. Nagel, this morning there was a very significant item in the paper. It was this: There was quoted a top-secret document of the American Defense Department. How it got there, we will never know probably. But that top-secret document brought out one fact that really answers your question. It was this. There was a military estimate made in September 1947 by military men, and it had this conclusion: The military occupation of South Korea is not essential to the military security of the United States of America."
5.32598605839139e-05,0.999946740139416,1314_11,0,Tied to that problem is this one of Civil Service.  You put Ike and his friends in the administration and they will fire civil servants by the scores.  That is just bunk.  I have lived with those people a whole lot longer than some of the people who are now criticizing me and I like and admire them.
5.24693498288358e-05,0.999947530650171,1318_14,0,"Don't misunderstand me. I, for one, am ready to acknowledge the sincerity of the Republican President's desire for peace and happiness for all. But good intentions are not good enough and the country is stalled on dead center--stalled in the middle of the road--while the world goes whirling by. America, which has lifted man to his highest economic state, which has saved freedom in war and peace, which saved collective security, no longer sparks and flames and gives off new ideas and initiatives. Our lights are dimmed. We chat complacently of this and that while, in Carlyle's phrase, Death and eternity sit glaring. And I could add that opportunity, neglected opportunity, sits glaring too!"
6.19704875343081e-05,0.999938029512466,1319_13,0,"Responsible union leaders have proposed programs for industrial rehabilitation and aid to distressed areas. The Democratic platform endorses these proposals. Senator Paul Douglas and other Democrats have already introduced bills in Congress to establish such programs. I hope that when Congress reconvenes they can, with a White House endorsement they have so far lacked, be enacted into law."
5.84888246230196e-05,0.999941511175377,1322_4,0,"I want to pay tribute, on the Labor Day, to the magnificent role that American labor, under the leadership of the AFL-CIO, has played in the world wide struggle with Communism. No agency, public or private, has been more effective in arousing the hearts and minds of the plain people of the Free World to an awareness of the menace. By its leadership in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, American labor has welded the free trade unions of every nation into a solid front against Communism."
5.23415385558775e-05,0.999947658461444,1326_13,0,"Even more is it true that our hopes for peace in the world are still far from realization, the ultimate peace far from being won. I said earlier this week at the American Legion Convention in Los Angeles that: There is not peace--the peace we seek--while our sons and brothers are still being drafted for two years of military service, their schooling interrupted, their normal lives postponed."
5.62063753021371e-05,0.999943793624698,1328_16,0,Their technique has been ingenious and ruthless. They have done on the infighting what they couldn't do in the open. They say they believe in public housing! But they put a declared enemy of public housing in charge of the public housing program.
5.49858784766467e-05,0.999945014121523,1342_3,0,"Yet only a few weeks later he made his unhappy peace with the party. That was when he said, on October 30, 1953, that he favored the election of every Republican over every Democrat for every office any place. And that is the course he has pursued ever since. He has not hesitated to endorse any Republican, be he a Taft Republican or a McCarthy Republican. The only notable exception was an Eisenhower Republican--Senator Wiley of Wisconsin, for whom the President didn't lift a finger. It used to be said that Mr. Eisenhower would reshape the Republican party. You cannot help but wonder today who has reshaped whom."
5.08329373150672e-05,0.999949167062685,1351_15,0,"Words--empty words--have nowhere been so damaging and nowhere so cruel as in the Republican discussion of foreign policy. Those of Polish and Eastern European origin will remember particularly how the Republican orators--how Secretary of State Dulles--talked about liberation four years ago. This talk of liberation also had only one purpose. It was to win votes from the gullible by creating hopes of rescuing friends and relatives who lived behind the Iron Curtain. And they know now how cynical and empty that talk was. Instead of liberating anyone, four years later half of Indochina is gone and Soviet influence is spreading even in the political and economic field."
5.31498619180776e-05,0.999946850138082,1367_28,0,"What the Old Guard Republican leaders did to get their man in was to decide, coldly and with due calculation, that the personal popularity of one man was great enough that the general distrust of another wouldn't matter. They concluded, or rather they hoped, that enough voters would cast a ballot for one man's popularity without regard to the possible consequences if another became President. I think they were wrong. I think the people of this country do not view the vice presidency-- at least in these times-- as a casual incident. They know what the vice presidency is this nation's life insurance policy. They are going to read the fine print. And I don't think they are going to go for four years uninsured."
5.01321770006325e-05,0.999949867822999,1377_5,0,"At Peoria, four years later, the President told his Republican audience that what he meant at Kasson, was that farmers should get their parity in the marketplace. If that means anything, it means they should get parity without price supports. And if that is what Mr. Eisenhower meant, why didn't he say so four years ago? He didn't say so because he knew that any such statement would have cost him."
0.000287242902098889,0.999712757097901,1388_7,0,"We badly need to get down to fundamentals. The first is that whatever the provocation, aggression can no longer be tolerated in the atomic age. This has been our position always. We welcome the U.N. resolution as expressing the sense of the world community on this point, and we all hope that a cease-fire can be promptly arranged."
5.25757340887091e-05,0.999947424265911,1391_15,0,"And distasteful as this matter is, I must say bluntly that every piece of scientific evidence we have, every lesson of history and experience, indicates that a Republican victory tomorrow would mean that Richard M. Nixon would probably be president of this country within the next four years. I say frankly, as a citizen more than a candidate, that I recoil at the prospect of Mr. Nixon as custodian of this nation's future, as guardian of the hydrogen bomb, as representative of America in the world, as Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces. Distasteful as it is, this is the truth, the central truth, about the most fateful decision the American people have to make tomorrow. I have full confidence in that decision."
7.29887201329859e-05,0.999927011279867,1398_34,0,"We cannot prove wise and strong by any such simple device as suspending, unilaterally, our H-bomb tests. Our atomic knowledge and power have forged the saving shield of freedom. And the future use and control of atomic power can be assured, not by any theatrical national gesture, but only by explicit and supervised international agreements."
6.23742408042554e-05,0.999937625759195,1402_18,0,"In the meantime, wages have been raised and the cost of living has been extraordinarily stable in the last three years. It is true that you can say technically the cost of living is high. It has gone up 2.5 percent since we have been in, but it went up 45 percent or more in the last seven years of the preceding administration."

5.32658033285616e-05,0.999946734196671,1412_1,0,"We are also deeply grateful that so many Americans have signed their names that they are determined to do their duty this fall in determining the course of America, and are going to get their friends to do the same. I cannot remember any birthday that has been quite so deeply meaningful to me as this one. I thank all of you--Mr. Percy and Miss Dunne particularly for being the chairmen of this great evening."
5.37054140098068e-05,0.99994629458599,1425_5,0,"Now, in the work for peace, again, each of us has a job to do--to make certain that our nation stays strong, that we live in the faith of our fathers, that peace can finally be achieved for the world, that we can do our part in right thinking, in working at our daily jobs to convince others in the world that we want none of their property, we don't want to dominate them, we merely want the opportunity for all men who love freedom to have it, to hold it, and to enjoy it. This is our task, not only for those who are in the Congress and in the state gubernatorial chairs and in the legislatures. All of us--America--must stand together, stand strong and be of one mind if we are, from our position of strength, going to lead really on the road of peace."

In those lands, the fruits of imperialism are discontent, unrest, riots in one place and demonstrations in another, until the tyranny exercised over them either dissolves or is expelled. The day of liberation may be postponed where armed forces for a time make protest suicidal. But all history testifies that the memory of freedom is not erased by the fear of guns, and the love of freedom is more enduring than the power of tyrants. But it is necessary that the inspiration of freedom, and the benefits enjoyed by those who possess it, are known to those oppressed."

This is it:Go to Miami. Just spend a few hours there. See what the people of that area have done on their own, for themselves and for the good of our whole country."
5.43488066963998e-05,0.999945651193304,1430_10,0,"This, I maintain, is the difference between us. Now, through these past four years, there has been one subject that this administration has lived with, worked with, done more with, than any other and that is trying to develop and build the road to peace. Without peace, we cannot have these things that we have been enjoying the past four years.  We cannot have lowered taxes, we cannot have prosperity, we cannot have confidence among ourselves."

We believe, with the Constitution, in the equality before the law of every single American. In making this a reality in this day and time, we believe in cooperation. We believe that in getting the cooperation that comes about from willing working together of Americans, you achieve much more than you do just by writing a hard and fixed dictum of law and say everybody must conform."

This train is headed not only south, but it is headed toward Washington.  I think in many ways the election of 1960 comes at a time more dangerous for our country, more trying for all of us, a period of greater responsibility for every citizen than any election since the election of 1860.  In that time, as you recall, the great issue was whether this country could stay united, whether it would, in the words of Lincoln, exist half slave and half free.  The issue in the election of 1960 involves not only the well-being of the people of this valley, involves not only the development of your natural resources, but as citizens of the United States and leaders of the free world, we must be concerned about such far-off places as the Congo, India, and Indonesia, the security of those countries, as well as the well-being of their people.  "

Last year we had the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.  We've got a million and a half people coming into the market every year seeking jobs.  Unless this country moves ahead, unless we continue to grow, unless our defenses are strong, unless we're educating our children, unless we are showing in every way, in science, in space, and here in Texas, that this country is first, not to follow when or where, but first--and that's what the Democratic party wants to do in the 1960s."

I am not at all. I could not possibly feel stronger about this country and about what it can do. But I think the Republicans have put limitations on what we can do. We want to upgrade the leadership.

Now, as the market price drops so drops the support price.  Where you had $1.50 for corn eight years ago, you may be getting 90 cents for corn today, or 93 cents.  That is the market price.  Mr. Nixon will pay you 90 percent of that market price next year, and if it drops to 85 cents, he will pay you 90 percent of that, and that is the step, down, down, down, until farmers are driven off their farms in increasing numbers."

What I want to do today is to talk over with you some of my views based on this serious study. At the outset I would like this point clearly understood: the problems of farm people ought not be approached, as far too often has been the case in the past, as something to exploit for political advantage.  Rather, the approach has got to be objective, and has got to be constructive.  In a determined effort to find a solution, the good of the farmer, not the good of politicians, has to be our steady purpose if we are ever to get anywhere."

We have to have better schools and better housing, better jobs with progress.  How are we going to get it?  Well, let me tell you this.  I could tell you that the way to get it is just to leave it to Washington, that Washington is going to provide the jobs and the schools and the progress we need, but that isn't the way it work in this country of ours.  The way to progress in America is not through putting the responsibility on the federal government, but for the federal government to adopt policies that will stimulate the incentive and the creative ability of 180 million free Americans, just such as you here."

The thing that ran through my mind I'm sure was what would run through your mind--that the most important question and the most important responsibility for the next president of the United States is to see that those boys and thousands like them are always in uniforms of peace and never have to be in uniforms of war. And so I say to you today that the most important responsibility of the next president is to keep the peace without surrender and that is the question you should ask--which of the candidates--which of the two for president and vice president will best provide that leadership.

Second, as far as the future is concerned, I would say that we can look at our experience, I cannot talk about mine.  That is your prerogative to judge that, but I can talk about my running mate's, and I say there's no man in the world today who has had more experience, who has done a better job of representing the cause of peace and freedom than Henry Cabot Lodge, our candidate for Vice President, at the United Nations."

I'll tell you why.  Because we know him.  We know the Communists.  We sat opposite the table with them.  We know what they're trying to do.  Here are fanatical, ruthless men who are determined to conquer the world, determined to conquer it by any means, if necessary.  But when we consider them, then, we've got to recognize that they're going to cause us trouble--they're going to cause us trouble every time they can.  They're not going to cause us trouble only if we do what they want us to do.  And that means turn over the world to them."

He sets forth before the United Nations a program that will work, one that will make certain that when one party disarms, the other does likewise, and unless we have that kind of agreement, America can never reduce its strength--and I know all of you agree with that. And, so, I say to you tonight: I stand here speaking of this record.  I stand here talking of experience but most of all, I stand here to tell you that my colleague and I, knowing the men with whom we deal, know that we can never rest for a moment on our record, that we must move forward militarily.

We have a great humanitarian concern, and one of the reasons that we have developed this concern is because of the contribution made by people that make up the mainstream of American life.  Who are they?  They came from all the countries of the world.  Warm-hearted Italians, people from Europe, from Asia, from Africa, these are Americans.  And because America is the whole world, America will always have a feeling and a concern for misery and hunger and want in the whole world."

All the criticism in the world of the Eisenhower record in the field of foreign policy isn't going to fool the American people because they know what it is and they like it.  They know that in 1953, when Eisenhower became president, we were in a war.  They know that in these last seven and a half years we got this nation out of one war, we've kept her out of others, and we do have peace without surrender today and they want to continue that kind of leadership."

Such efforts toward personal security, first, are right--not only from the humanitarian viewpoint, which all of us will understand--they are mandatory if our complex modern society is to work at its best, at its fullest.  They are essential to our purpose.  And what is that purpose?  I think, summed up in a sentence, it is this: we must lift the ceiling over personal opportunity.  We must strengthen the floor over the pit of personal disaster.  Public policy, therefore, should seek to put right what is wrong in our America, but it should also seek to strengthen what is right.  It should recognize the plain fact that Americans are proud and self-reliant individuals.  Programs that encourage individuals to depend on government are wrong, for increasing dependence by a people upon government is not a sign of strength; it is a sign of weakness, and in this day of competition with the Communists, Americans must be sturdy and strong."

The Paris conference, you remember, was the one that Mr. Khrushchev broke up.  He said he broke it up at the time because the President had ordered the U-2 flights, you recall, which were ordered to protect the security of the United States, to get information about whether there was a surprise attack being mounted against the United States, and at that time Mr. Khrushchev demanded that the President of the United States apologize or express regrets for those flights.

No, I say, we can have progress and that we will have it, but that the way to get it is not through programs which, in effect, will say, Turn over all these problems to the Federal Government.  Let us have your money and we'll spend it for you.

I have been there when he has made the great decisions, and the thing that the President has done is that he has always been firm.  He has never shot from the hip.  He has always made it clear that the United States is not going to surrender principle or territory any place in the world."

As I look over a crowd like this, as I realize the inconvenience and the discomfort that was caused to you to have to come here, it makes me know what a tremendous and awesome responsibility it is even to be running for president and even to be thinking of the possibility of being president of this country. I can only tell you that, as see this crowd, I will never forget this day in Marion.  I will remember the people who came here, who stood in the rain and who looked at me, listened to what I have to say, and if you believe, and if your verdict will be, that I am the one to serve you, I want you to know that I will do everything in my power in working for a better America, an America in which we can all move forward together, leaving none behind, an America in which the young people of this country will have greater opportunities than we have even had in our time, and a world in which all men can be free, in which we can live in peace."

This campaign is one in which I ask you to vote not as Republicans, not as Democrats, or Independents, but as Americans, thinking of what this nation needs and what the world needs in the years ahead.   I say this because I have seen the world, because I have had the opportunity to know the problems with which we are confronted, and because I know that the decisions that the next president makes may determine the difference between whether we have peace or war, between whether we have freedom, for ourselves and for the whole world: therefore, I urge all of you to consider the qualifications of the candidates on the basis not simply of the labels you may wear, but on the basis of whether you think what we stand for is best for America."

I say it because this year, 1960, we are electing not only the leader of America, but the leader of the free world. This year, 1960, we elect a man who will determine what will happen in the United States, but also who will determine what will happen in the world, and I say it is not enough simply to vote on the basis of how your father voted or your grandfather voted or the label you may wear. What we must do is to put America first and the party second--and that is best for us and best for America. "

You know, the easy thing to do is to come to a state like this and say to you: the federal government is going to take over all of your problems. The federal government is going to promise you this, that, and the other thing. As a matter of fact, it's rather interesting that when we look at this campaign, it's had a rather amusing twist in a sense because, as you notice, the slogan that our opposition is using: Kennedy is the remedy. Well, you know, that's like the old medicine man who used to come to town--the same remedy for everything--spend more money--and that's your money. Now, the difference was, you know, that the medicine man had the same remedy--different labels on the bottle--it would cure snakebite or rheumatism or anything else, but it really didn't do it; and the difference was the medicine man always got out of town just before the people caught up with the fact that the remedy didn't work.

The Senator recognized Saddam Hussein was a threat and authorized force to remove him, until his Democratic opponent Howard Dean began gaining ground as an antiwar candidate.

The Senator was all for removing Saddam Hussein when we went into Baghdad. He was very supportive when we captured him. After all, the polls showed that that was very popular at the time.

The idea that the president would cut Medicare for current — for current seniors in order to pay for his — you know, his legacy, Obamacare, is something which I don't think the American people understand the impact on them and their families.

The average teacher in America today starts at about $14,000 or $13,000 a year.  In some states it's far less.  I was in Florida a year ago, and I saw a teacher's schedule that showed a teacher who had twenty years of teaching with a doctorate degree made $17,000 a year.  I may be off a couple thousand, but I remember being shocked by the figure.  I have talked to any number of young people who went into teaching full of hope and found out they just couldn't stick with it, couldn't afford it.  I talked to a young man in New Hampshire.  I don't think he voted for me based on the returns, but we had a nice conversation.  He told me that, more than anything, he wanted to be a science teacher.  But he had a family of two kids, he was now thirty-six years of age.  He said, I couldn't do it.  I had to get out.  And I made double or triple whatever it was in the private sector.  What is happening today is that a lot of young, skilled people are not going into education.  The tests show that a disproportionate number are testing at the lowest levels of skills and aptitudes.  That doesn't mean a lot of them won't become good teachers.  We ought to have a society in which both in terms of the environment of teaching being honored as a profession and the pay, is such that the very best, the top of each class, goes into education.  I think last year--as I recall, in Los Angeles--I believe I was told that a beginning teacher there made $13,000 and a beginning policeman $28,000.  I don't begrudge the policeman's salary at all.  But we're saying something about teaching when we give it this low status, and, of course, our kids will pay and our nation will pay.  By now we should know that it is the product of the trained mind that is the greatest source of wealth in America.  It's more important than all of our national resources, everything.  That's from an economic standpoint.  But education, of course--that's why I use the word learning--goes to the basis of our democracy, to our personal enrichment and fulfillment, of our understanding of this ever more dangerous world in which we live.  Education does everything that we need.  And it all begins with what goes on in that classroom.  If it's not effective, if we don't have the best teaching, it's not going to work.  As president, I intend to put a tremendous amount of attention on this.  I've spent a lot of my life in it.

And so the third element of a Clinton-Gore AIDS policy is to guarantee that all people with HIV have access to affordable quality care and treatment. Of course, many of the problems that people who are HIV-positive have are shared by other Americans. Seventy million of us have no adequate health insurance and about 37 million have no health insurance at all. Countless Americans fear that a sudden illness or accident will force the choice literally between their money or their lives. Under our heath care system, all Americans will have access to quality and affordable heath care through coverage from their employer, or if they're unemployed, through their government. Our plan will include voluntary, confidential, and anonymous testing and counseling for HIV, as well as the monitoring, therapy and drugs that people who test positive need. And experimental therapies will be more accessible to people with HIV."

My central goal is to raise our sights, raise our standards, and raise our expectations. Jack Kemp and I are going to get this economy moving again with a pro-growth plan that starts with a phased-in tax cut of 15 percent across the board.

5.48468638282781e-05,0.999945153136171,1016_0,0,"Mr. Conte, ladies and gentlemen, and boys and girls: I see by that sign down there that Dunkirk is for Stevenson. But I still don't feel that I am wasting my time by coming out here, and I am very grateful to all of you for being here, and to all of these children. I hope you are not cutting school."
5.55271713812952e-05,0.999944472828618,1021_9,0,"There always has to be a whistle in a whistle-stop, as far as I can see. May I thank the band for coming out here this morning. You have done me a great courtesy, and I am very grateful to you."
5.27256831206418e-05,0.99994727431688,1032_10,0,"Well, the world passed them by. Since then, we have been through a Great Depression, a great recovery and a devastating war. And somewhere in this process America has fundamentally changed--a new view, a new compassion, a new faith has emerged. In a way it is a moral revival, and it has altered the tone and the meaning of our life. And how different a prospect faces a young man or a young woman of today from what faced the youth of my generation. The only or, most of all, the go-getter was the hero. Few cared about politics or public service -almost none who went through school or college with me took any positive interest in that, or have subsequently. Few had the sense of civil or social responsibility that we find today, when they were young."
7.94339686145242e-05,0.999920566031385,1033_23,0,"Of course they don't mean to aid and abet our enemies; but the results are the same. Are these the men we want to lead our nation in the struggle against Communism today? All the while they proclaim ferocious anti-Communism. Indeed, the best way they can apparently find to obscure their retreat from the fight against Communism abroad, the fight to keep it distant from our shores, is by shouting and screaming every hour on the hour about how much they hate Communism at home."
5.65901391069082e-05,0.999943409860893,1068_1,0,"I am most grateful to all of you for coming out here at this inconvenient hour and I appreciate your courtesy, and I am sure that your presence here is a good omen both for the Democratic party and for our country. When so many people get up so early in the morning to hear about the great issues on which we will make a decision next Tuesday, we can all feel confident that the future of America rests in responsible hands. It is a sign that every one of you is taking seriously your duty as a citizen; for, in our country it is the people who make all of the final decisions."
5.3438813856157e-05,0.999946561186144,1074_2,0,"Then--then the people will vote on Tuesday. I understand that on Wednesday the newspapers plan to publish a Five-Star Final. Many thousands of our votes will come from rank-and-file Republicans who will vote with us. No doubt some Democrats will vote for the Republican candidates. We have already, for example, traded a couple of southern governors for the senator from Oregon and the vice chairman of the National Young Republicans. And I regard this as a profitable exchange for us. I would be happy to throw in a second baseman--but not Jackie Robinson."
5.51095296709122e-05,0.999944890470329,1081_7,0,"     We Democrats are for private and we are for profitable business.  We know America could not survive with any other kind.  We are for the dynamic system of enterprise which has grown out of the great partnership of public and private initiative in this country.  We are against socialism--creeping, crawling, loping, galloping, or even the make-believe kind that takes up so much space in the Republican oratory these days."
5.65613288613368e-05,0.999943438671139,1083_5,0,"Democratic administrations have fought to bring these things to you, not because that would win votes, but because they were right and just and fair.  And we are going to continue to shout and do what we think is right to extend the gains that we have made here at home, and to fight for peace abroad. In the conduct of our foreign affairs we will suffer no tyranny over us, just as we will suffer no tyranny of one American over another.  We want to impose no tyranny on any other people.  We will remain free ourselves--more so.  We will find, as we have found before, the balance between the power we generate and the brakes that will check the power of those hostile to us.  In this way we can move in the wide open world as our fathers did when our nation was founded, and we can move unafraid.  I am reluctant to stop, although I have talked entirely too much, both here and all throughout this campaign.  All the same I have left much unsaid that is in my heart.  All I can do now is to thank all of you and, through you, thank all Americans for the privilege of your attention in these past months."
5.71121114496718e-05,0.99994288788855,1084_9,0,"I think you know and I know that they have never really been ahead at any time. They just throw so much confetti at each other, read so many of each other's editorials, and cheer each other's speeches so loudly, that they begin to think that everyone agrees with them. Well, they don't. And I think you can rely on the American people every time to tell who is really talking sense and who isn't. "
5.73529368039773e-05,0.999942647063196,1092_14,0,"I don't know how thick your hide is.  But it's my belief that most Americans are ready to say, This is too much.  That is exactly what you and every other voting American will have the chance to say on November 4th."
5.25976738172553e-05,0.999947402326183,1101_15,0,"We are in that war because this administration allowed America, in a time when strength was needed, to become weak.  Consequently it felt compelled to take its forces out of that region. We are in that war because, having helped set up the Korean Republic, and knowing that strength was being massed against that republic north of its borders, there was a failure to build up adequate strength in Korea's own defense forces."
5.95438882340554e-05,0.999940456111766,1130_24,0,"Next, I want to see maintained the Constitutional relationship between the federal and the state governments.  My oath of office would demand that.  My convictions would require it.   The federal government did not create the states in this republic.  The states created the federal government.  The creation should not supersede the creator."
5.45130128960307e-05,0.999945486987104,1137_6,0,"Much of my life in the service of my country I have been forced to spend abroad.  It does one thing for you, ladies and gentlemen.  It makes certain that every time you come back you think more of this country.  If there is any veteran in this whole crowd who didn't have that same feeling when he came stemming into New York or San Francisco or Seattle or Norfolk, then I would be astonished because I have never yet met one who has not said, Well, one good thing a tour abroad does for you; it makes you understand how well worthwhile it is working here at home."
5.45908376931229e-05,0.999945409162307,1150_1,0,"I had a wonderful story told me about your town, that only last August in the midst of carrying on your fair you had a great storm that destroyed the buildings and tents and it looked like it was going to be disaster and no fair.  You people pitched in on your own.  You didn't even wait for a Washington bureaucrat to come down and do it.  You did it yourselves.  Moreover, I am told what you could expect in that little incident, that the elephant stayed on the job working until the last and the donkey played out--just too old, too tired."
5.15230488662674e-05,0.999948476951134,1170_2,0,"Now, that is the kind of recommendation that is easy to carry out.  What I am discussing as I go around is the incompetent leadership you have gotten over the past seven years from your administration in Washington.  And I go into the various subjects of our lack of progress toward peace, our excessive expenditures on the federal level, the deficits that are cheapening our money, the crises that are going up, the taxes that grow more and more burdensome; and, with all of the necessary expenditures for defense organisms that we must have, still a kind of incompetence in government that gets two airfields in North Africa for the price of five and the kind of thing going on in the Justice Department that led an ex-under secretary, a high official in the Justice Department, to say only yesterday, Why, if my ex-chief should tell all he knew, they would blow the White House so high that the power of gravity could not bring it back."
5.59255207936778e-05,0.999944074479206,1174_9,0,"Can this burden be lightened without endangering national security? A Democrat administration--stale and self-satisfied from being too long in power complacently says: No, nothing can be done. That is not an American answer. Our answer is: Yes, much can be done."
5.30377384913603e-05,0.999946962261508,1179_4,0,"That record is a distinguished one.  It should be remembered that the negative votes on the North Atlantic Treaty, the Vandenberg Resolution and the Marshall Plan included negative votes of the party in power.  That is a tribute not just to a man but to a party.  Senator Vandenberg, if he were living, would be the first one to resent the suggestion that the votes to which I refer represented a personal triumph.  Rather, they represented to him the dedication of a party which, although it was an opposition party, subordinated partisan considerations to the national welfare."
5.73940258719747e-05,0.999942605974128,1187_0,0,"Good afternoon, folks.  You know, folks, it strikes me that Senator Dirksen must indeed be a very powerful Senator when he can arrange by remote control such weather for this meeting.  I pay my compliments to him.  To each of you I extend my very warm thanks for coming here this afternoon, for giving me a chance to greet you, to say hello, and to express to you one or two thoughts that I have in mind as we progress in this political campaign."
5.10311516789916e-05,0.999948968848321,1197_13,0,"In Omaha the statements made in the Kasson speech in Minnesota were extended.  It is in the record as to what the Republican Party expects to do, purposes to do, with price supports, with REA, with cooperatives, with all of those things that mean so much to farm life today.  And that means perishable products as well as nonperishables.  So all of this talk about the Republican Party trying to put the farmer in the poor house is about as weak an argument as they could develop.  They say we want to abolish good times, that everybody will be out with a tin cup on the bread lines.  I made a talk the other night at Peoria where I took to pieces this so-called Democrat prosperity to show that the only advance in living standards the American people have made in the last 20 years was during the five years of World War II.  I do not believe that America wants a prosperity that is based upon the risks and sacrifices that men have to make in uniform against an enemy."
5.4509893895679e-05,0.999945490106104,1207_1,0,"You know, this thing seems to me to be particularly significant:  this evening there will be 6,000 more Americans than there were last evening.  Those Americans, of course, are largely our new babies born.  When each baby is born today it gets a very extraordinary present as it arrives into this world:  it gets its share of the national debt; it owes $1,750 for the privilege of having been born."
5.35921186691176e-05,0.999946407881331,1210_2,0,"First of all, of course, corruption is an expense piled onto all of the necessary expenditures that you people must bear.  By this I mean the actual cost in dollars is something that you have to add onto all these wasteful and extravagant expenses, as well as the necessary expenses.  But the great damage done to us by corruption in government is, after all, not just the few dollars it takes out of our tax revenues and our pockets.  This mess in Washington lowers our prestige abroad and robs us of pride in our own government.  If we are going to restore pride in government, who is going to do it?  You can't take an organization that has been in power far too long and merely by doing a little face-lifting job, doing a little repaint job, get by with it.  Actually, I believe that the administration candidate said all it needed was a little refreshening.  But as far as I am concerned, how do you refreshen a bad egg?"
5.76561873121325e-05,0.999942343812688,1216_17,0,"Now, of course, with the expenditure programs that are required today for necessary purposes, there cannot be any escape for the moment from high costs and high taxes and high prices.  Which makes it all the more necessary that we watch with a jaundiced eye anything that is unnecessary--all of the waste, the duplication, the inefficiency that we know about, and which you would not expect me here today at this time to enumerate.  That must be eliminated and it is the second purpose of this crusade."
6.9212626190183e-05,0.99993078737381,1220_4,0,"Just north of where we are gathered tonight passes a historic line that encircles the globe.  This line is invisible in America, but in another land it is traced in blood.  It is the 38th parallel, the line which divides North and South Korea."
5.34489559580849e-05,0.999946551044042,1222_3,0,"If on top of that we have the military force we need then we are strong.  But how will we do all those things?  We will do them ladies and gentlemen only if we are a united people, united behind the great aspirations and purposes of our government.  And right there is the crux of the matter.  You must have a government that you trust, respect and believe in, if you are going to have a united United States.  A united United States would be a strong bulwark of peace.  A united strong United States can lead the free nations of the world into that kind of collective security program that will lift a great burden from our hearts:  the burden of fear abroad."
5.29477354392282e-05,0.999947052264561,1226_0,0,"My first and most pleasant duty, of course, is to thank you for coming out here today.  You give me a chance to look in your faces, to bring you a word of greeting, and to give you one or two of the thoughts that are on my mind as we go through this political campaign.  I have had a wonderful day and a half in your state, starting up at Sacramento.  It seems to me I have been covering ground very rapidly and every place there seems to be a new surprise.  Now, for example, here when the so-called professional politicians began to give me my lessons in this new art a few months back, they told me there was one thing you could not do-go to an airport and address a group of American citizens.  I was told they simply wouldn't come.  So I find out today that at least in Long Beach those political friends of mine were wrong, and I am delighted."
5.26319682668354e-05,0.999947368031733,1249_17,0,"There is a cruel duplicity involved on the part of an administration which has pledged social security for some, and then through waste and careless financial policies, has caused an inflationary insecurity for all. And now we come to another glaring example of our national leadership's failure to live up to high ideals.  I refer to the McCarran Immigration Law, which was passed over the president's veto at the last session of Congress.  A new immigration law was certainly needed.  But with leadership, rather than vetoes, we should have had, and we must get, a better law than this McCarran Act."
5.82065838663701e-05,0.999941793416133,1296_0,0,"My friends of Nassau County:  Let me observe, first, that when the heart is full, the tongue is rarely glib.  So I am not certain what I shall say to you this morning.  I have just been traveling the roads of Nassau County, and never have I been greeted with more cordiality, with greater evidences of hospitality.  I am deeply grateful not only to everyone who was along the road this morning to wave a cheery hello, but to each of you here who has come out to allow me to bring a word of greeting and to express to you one or two of the thoughts on my mind as we go through his political campaign."
6.01405428013838e-05,0.999939859457199,1298_4,0,"Under the guarantee that in this land all men are created equal, your peoples have produced leaders in every field of endeavor--in business and industry, in government, in science and engineering, in medicine and agriculture, in education, in arts and letters.  You have furnished a large share of the manpower and brain power which have made our farms and factories the most productive in the world.  Your people have been in the vanguard of the evolution in this country of an enlightened labor policy.  You have fought to defend America and the principles for which she stands."
5.14941663623389e-05,0.999948505833638,1300_38,0,"A: You know, fortunately, Mr. Nagel, this morning there was a very significant item in the paper. It was this: There was quoted a top-secret document of the American Defense Department. How it got there, we will never know probably. But that top-secret document brought out one fact that really answers your question. It was this. There was a military estimate made in September 1947 by military men, and it had this conclusion: The military occupation of South Korea is not essential to the military security of the United States of America."
5.89999734570381e-05,0.999941000026543,1303_4,0,"The essential difference between this worn-out bureaucracy in Washington and the crusade is this:  They want to sit in Washington and direct your lives and your businesses and check up on you from thousands or hundreds of miles away.  We want to see you develop yourselves with every single thing you have got in you and hold the government ready to help you whenever it is necessary, but to work with you and not just to work you. We believe that if we bring to Washington the outstanding men and women of this crusade--your representatives, people coming right out of this crowd, men who have been introduced to you from this platform--that all of those people will be your guarantee that there is no crookedness in government, that subversion and Communism isn't getting inside of government.  They will be your guarantee that if a stray individual does go bad and betrays his trust, that kind of thing will be ripped out of government without delay."
5.55249739210596e-05,0.999944475026079,1305_2,0,"You will notice that the state of Montana is the only one that has a Democrat governor, and we are going to change that next month. Let's hear briefly from each of these Western governors.  First, the able chief executive of Arizona, my very good friend, Governor Howard Pyle."
6.51278348804717e-05,0.999934872165119,1312_11,0,"What is extraordinary is that the present administration continues to pretend that none of these things have been so--that everything that has happened--every stolen secret, every disloyal official--is, they say, just an unfortunate, almost insignificant, accident. We could make some allowance for them if they had the honesty or the common sense, or both, to admit that they had been deceived and to show a stern purpose of preventing similar subversion in the future. There has been considerable concern--and rightfully so--about methods to be used in rooting Communism out of our government."
5.96286389832494e-05,0.999940371361016,1318_18,0,"With leadership, Democratic leadership, we can restore the vitality of the American family farm. We can preserve the position of the small business without injury to the large. We can strengthen labor unions and collective bargaining as vital institutions in a free economy. We can and our party history proves that we will!"
6.44693768761661e-05,0.999935530623124,1319_13,0,"Responsible union leaders have proposed programs for industrial rehabilitation and aid to distressed areas. The Democratic platform endorses these proposals. Senator Paul Douglas and other Democrats have already introduced bills in Congress to establish such programs. I hope that when Congress reconvenes they can, with a White House endorsement they have so far lacked, be enacted into law."
5.42508619296651e-05,0.999945749138071,1319_3,0,"No leader in our country has done more, I think, to make state government an instrument for serving the responsible interests of working people--along with all other human interests--than has your great Governor Mennen Williams. Nor has any voice in Washington in these past two years spoken out more plainly and effectively for the rights of labor than that of Senator Pat McNamara. It is a special privilege for me to join you in saluting here today, on its twentieth anniversary, one of democracy's truly great organizations, the United Automobile Workers; and its president, my friend, one of freedom's truest and most effective servants, Walter Reuther."
6.17956037538566e-05,0.999938204396246,1337_28,0,"The twenty-six years of Republican government have produced a record largely of stagnation, of complacency, and of drift. The Republican leadership cannot hope to meet the challenge of the future--because it can hardly bear to live in the present. The pace of change is quickening every moment, with every new discovery in our laboratories, every new invention in our workshops, every new upsurge of human ambition and hope in the revolutionary turbulence of the world. To meet the challenge of the twentieth century we need every resource of imagination, of intelligence, of courage, and of faith."
5.38113535812398e-05,0.999946188646419,1342_3,0,"Yet only a few weeks later he made his unhappy peace with the party. That was when he said, on October 30, 1953, that he favored the election of every Republican over every Democrat for every office any place. And that is the course he has pursued ever since. He has not hesitated to endorse any Republican, be he a Taft Republican or a McCarthy Republican. The only notable exception was an Eisenhower Republican--Senator Wiley of Wisconsin, for whom the President didn't lift a finger. It used to be said that Mr. Eisenhower would reshape the Republican party. You cannot help but wonder today who has reshaped whom."
5.33580007047732e-05,0.999946641999296,1364_8,0,"Does the President really object to his administration being called indifferent to unemployment? I remind him that his Secretary of Defense talked about workers out of jobs as kennel or hunting dogs, and that it was a White House assistant who said of unemployment this spring that the right to suffer is one of the joys of a free economy. And I want to say something, too, about another kind of indifference. I mean about the crisis in education in this country. The President said last night that twice in his State of the Union messages--in 1955 and 1956--he urged swift action--and that he even called a conference on education."
5.64060121634757e-05,0.999943593987836,1367_28,0,"What the Old Guard Republican leaders did to get their man in was to decide, coldly and with due calculation, that the personal popularity of one man was great enough that the general distrust of another wouldn't matter. They concluded, or rather they hoped, that enough voters would cast a ballot for one man's popularity without regard to the possible consequences if another became President. I think they were wrong. I think the people of this country do not view the vice presidency-- at least in these times-- as a casual incident. They know what the vice presidency is this nation's life insurance policy. They are going to read the fine print. And I don't think they are going to go for four years uninsured."
5.4242145308268e-05,0.999945757854691,1367_9,0,"And, you know, he said that Eisenhower had had another new idea--to wage peace not war. When he said that I blinked and thought again of Woodrow Wilson and the last-ditch Republican fight against the League of Nations. I thought of Franklin Roosevelt and the United Nations. I thought of the Truman Doctrine, and aid to Greece and Turkey. I thought of the Marshall Plan, Point 4, and NATO and the great Democratic struggle of a generation for peace, in which I am proud to have played a very small part myself. "
5.4543900629757e-05,0.99994545609937,1369_5,0,"When there was a strike at the auto agency of this Cabinet businessman his comment was: I don't happen to go along with some of the goons they've got running things. Is that what they think of labor? When small-business failures reach an alarming rate, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior says, There are business failures even in times of great prosperity. It is part and parcel of our American way of life... I do not think we would want it different. Is that what they think of small business?"
5.65698247399209e-05,0.99994343017526,1378_35,0,What does Mr. Eisenhower propose then? That we go ahead with the development of the cobalt bomb to try to gain another advantage? A force that can shake the earth's axis.
5.88629905797749e-05,0.99994113700942,1424_5,0,"Now, permit me two observations. First, I offer a simple suggestion to any leader of the opposition. I suggest that, if I were anxious to win the confidence of the American people and remembering the Washington mess of only four years ago--there is one word that is the last that I would take from out the whole dictionary to use in a political argument--and that word is corruption. When this word is uttered in any political hall of the opposition, it echoes with a most curious ring. I know why, for I recall an old but grim proverb. It comes from the greatest Spanish novel ever written. And it warns: Never mention rope--in the house of one who has been hanged."
5.74673863172839e-05,0.999942532613683,1427_3,0,"And may I remark, with your permission, that if I were privileged tonight to speak also in your sister state of Connecticut, as I am privileged to speak here, I would speak of Senator Bush in exactly the same words. Now first of all, I feel great, largely because of the way you have greeted me. But tonight I am reminded, my friends, of the time when last we met here in the Garden four years ago."
5.37505275101541e-05,0.99994624947249,1428_4,0,"And so for the political pessimists who think Americans can accomplish nothing unless government bureaucracy does it for them, I have a prescription. This is it:Go to Miami. Just spend a few hours there. See what the people of that area have done on their own, for themselves and for the good of our whole country."
5.31953204164429e-05,0.999946804679584,1432_28,0,"And so we continue to build our strength, not to wage war, but to be spared war. We can judge today the need of this strength by a simple question: would we feel safe or secure as a nation if we, say five years ago in the past, had already ceased perfecting our military weapons and even abandoned our military draft? That is no formula for peace. It is a design for disaster."
5.66177222012622e-05,0.999943382277798,1436_12,0,"The world has been close to war before--but now man, who has survived all previous threats to his existence, has taken into his mortal hands the power to exterminate the entire species some seven times over. Here at home, the changing face of the future is equally revolutionary. The New Deal and the Fair Deal were bold measures for their generations--but this is a new generation."
5.45681967078153e-05,0.999945431803292,1443_0,0,"Governor Egan, Senator Bartlett, Senator Gruening, Congressman Rivers, and ladies and gentlemen, during the Democratic Convention I said that if I were nominated by that convention, I would start my campaign in the state of Alaska. That was a pledge I meant to keep. I am keeping it here now. I can assure you that I will keep all the other commitments that we make in this campaign."
5.3040849132419e-05,0.999946959150868,1477_4,0,"I was impressed by what Sam Rayburn said. I don't think there is any man in this century who has written more significant legislation of benefit to the people than Speaker Rayburn. He does it. He secures the support of the members of the House of Representatives from all states of the Union. He secures the undeviating loyalty of the majority leader from Massachusetts, John McCormack, his strong right arm, because they know that he speaks not only for Bonham, Texas; he speaks for the United States. And Lyndon Johnson, unanimously chosen on three different occasions by every senator of the United States in the Democratic Party to be the majority leader, was chosen because he was not only a senator from Texas, but a senator of the United States."

Unless this country moves ahead, unless we continue to grow, unless our defenses are strong, unless we're educating our children, unless we are showing in every way, in science, in space, and here in Texas, that this country is first, not to follow when or where, but first--and that's what the Democratic party wants to do in the 1960s."

What is true of McDowell County and true of the coal industry will be true of other industries stretching across the United States.

But in 1960, the cause of liberalism cannot content itself with carrying on the fight for human justice and economic liberalism here at home. For here and around the world, the fear of war hangs over us every morning and every night. It lies, expressed or silent, in the minds of every American. We cannot banish it by repeating that we are economically first or that we are militarily first, for saying so doesn't make it so.

More will be needed than good intentions, for we know where that paving leads."

But I want to say one or two things. I spoke this afternoon at the plowing contest on what I consider to be the number one domestic problem which the United States faces, and that is the sharp decline in agricultural income. I think the farmers of North Dakota and the farmers of South Dakota and of Minnesota and Montana have a very clear choice. The question is which party and which candidate can meet their problems in this state, and meet their in this country. They have heard from the Democratic party and they have heard from the Republican party. I remember when President Truman used to say that the farmers had themselves to blame for their difficulties because they voted Republican in 1952. But I don't hold that view wholly, because in 1952, the farmers were informed that the Republican party stood for 100 percent parity not once but at least three times."

And--at the same foreign ministers' conference--the United States suffered one of its few diplomatic defeats in the history of inter-American relations, when it was forced to withdraw its protest over Communist efforts in this hemisphere. This is a critical situation--to find so dangerous an enemy on our very doorstep.  The American people want to know how this was permitted to happen--how the Iron Curtain could have advanced almost to our front yard.  They want to know the truth--and I believe that they are entitled to the truth.  It is not enough to blame it on unknown state department personnel.  Major policy on issues such as Cuban security is made at the highest levels--in the national Security Council and elsewhere--and it is the party in power which must accept full responsibility for this disaster."

But what is the area of difference between us?  What is the issue on which you should base your decision?  You should not only make a judgment of Mr. Nixon and myself.  You should also make a judgment about yourselves, what you want, about what your view is of your country and your community, about what your view of the future is, whether you are satisfied today or wish to do better.  If you are satisfied, if you feel happy about your life, if you feel our country is meeting its responsibilities, then you belong in Mr. Nixon's camp.  But if you share the view that I hold very vigorously that this country is going to have to do better in the future, that we have responsibilities to meet not only to ourselves but to the cause of freedom, that we are anxious to make sure that in the future people decide that these days were great days in the life of our country, that we must move forward, we must stimulate our growth, we must hold out an image to the world of a vigorous, dynamic society, if we are going to continue to lead the free world--I believe that is the choice.

I think we must emphasize the things that unite America.  I pointed out in speaking to a great labor organization yesterday the fact that Mr. Kennedy had been in Detroit and made the statement that he was for everything union leaders were for, in effect, and that he opposed everything that they were against.  And I said to this group, Look, I'm for many of the things your leaders are for, but I'm not for all the things and I will not make a commitment that I'm for all the things that the leaders of unions or management or farm organizations or any other part or group of America are for, because a president must be president of all America and not just part of America."

I'll tell you why.  Because we know him.  We know the Communists.  We sat opposite the table with them.  We know what they're trying to do.  Here are fanatical, ruthless men who are determined to conquer the world, determined to conquer it by any means, if necessary.  But when we consider them, then, we've got to recognize that they're going to cause us trouble--they're going to cause us trouble every time they can.  They're not going to cause us trouble only if we do what they want us to do.  And that means turn over the world to them."

But again, we don't stand on it.  How do I say that we can do this job?  Well, first, when you look at my colleague and I, we know Mr. Khrushchev.  We have sat down across the conference table with him.  We know that he is a man who is ruthless and tough.  We know that you must never make him a concession unless you get a concession in return.  That's why President Eisenhower was right in not doing what Mr. Khrushchev asked him to do again in the paper this morning, in not apologizing and not expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev as Senator Kennedy suggested he might.  That is why the next president of the United States must recognize that Mr. Khrushchev does not react like Mr. Nehru, he isn't like Mr. Adenauer, or Mr. Macmillan.  He is a man determined to conquer the world and so, first, we will keep America strong--the strongest in the world.  Second, we will see that the economy of this country moves forward so that Mr. Khrushchev never will be able to get through on his boast that he is going to catch us.  Third, we will see that we are firm, but we will never be belligerent, because we realize that while we hold the line for principle, we must always negotiate for peace, but never, again, making concessions, as I say, which don't get concessions in return."

We have a great humanitarian concern, and one of the reasons that we have developed this concern is because of the contribution made by people that make up the mainstream of American life.  Who are they?  They came from all the countries of the world.  Warm-hearted Italians, people from Europe, from Asia, from Africa, these are Americans.  And because America is the whole world, America will always have a feeling and a concern for misery and hunger and want in the whole world."

And that's the way to get it, and not through just sending it down to Washington to create the jobs through what Washington spends. There was another point that I would make.  I make it here recognizing that most of the people in this great audience are those that have had rare opportunities.  You have had the chance to go up in your communities, to go to school.  You have not suffered from discrimination or prejudice, the great majority of you.  And the reason I mention it to you, the reason that I think it's particularly appropriate to say it here is because I don't know of any man in this country who at the state level, and who also in his life, has done a more effective job, or one who has believed more deeply than Governor Nelson Rockefeller in the field of creating equal opportunities for all of our people.

And so, one, we will keep America strong militarily, and the second thing we will do is this.  We will be firm in our diplomacy.  We know this man as I emphasized.  We know that he doesn't react like the leaders of the free world.  We know that the naive and well-intentioned people who suggest that a concession here or a concession there will lead to peace forget the lessons of history.  My friends, we learned in Korea, we learned in dealing with Hitler, that whenever you're confronted with a dictator the way to peace is to strengthen strength and firmness, and the way to war is through weakness, both militarily and diplomatically.  We stand for strength and firmness and that's what we're going to continue, and that's what the American people are going to vote for on November 8th. "

We must widen opportunities for all.  We must improve the quality of educational effort.  We must enhance the status of our teachers.  To that end, I have proposed a national program in support of education, emphasizing such elements as college scholarships for those who cannot under any circumstances afford to borrow and to pay back, tax credits or deductions to cover tuition and other costs of higher education, aid in school construction to provide needed facilities, and thereby to release local funds for raising teachers' salaries--all of this, however, particularly at the secondary and primary level, to be accomplished without compromising local controls of our school system."

And let me say to every housewife here: if you vote for our opponents, the prices of everything you buy in the grocery store will go up because of their farm program, incidentally, that won't help the farmer either; but it will certainly have that effect, and they know it.

Well, believe me, anybody who says America is standing still hasn't been traveling through America--I can assure you of that--as I have.  Look at this great area here.

Give us a taxpayer check-off so everybody here that pays taxes, if he wants to or if she decides to, can check off on that tax return 10 percent of the tax, to be used for one thing only: reducing the federal deficit. And Congress must find the spending cuts to go with it. Then give me what forty-three governors have--every day I get legislation down there, every day legislation comes down loaded up with pork--give me the line-item veto.

The other guys, they talked a lot about welfare reform and hating the government, but we reduced the government to its smallest size in 30 years. And we reduced the welfare rolls by 1.8 million. But I signed that welfare reform bill and I was proud to do it because--here's the new deal--there's a lot of legislators here, so you all listen to this. Here's the new deal. This deal says, for people who are poor and their children, eligible for welfare, you still get guaranteed health care, guaranteed food stamps and guaranteed child care if you go to work.

You remember how the two Republican parties pulled out their six-guns and went after each other in Chicago. Well, there is still today the same divided, confused, quarreling bunch we all saw on the TV screen when they had their scrimmage out there in the stockyards at Chicago."

It would be a sad thing, indeed, it seems to me, if a great soldier to whom we owe undying affection and gratitude ended up politically between the two Republican parties like that mule I heard about one time that starved to death standing between two stacks of hay, trying to make up his mind which to eat. Now, in a way, I sympathize with his plight; for some time I have been wondering when he was going to find something to say that would not offend one of the Republican parties. Now, at last I think he has found it. In recent days, he has come forth with a fine free-swinging attack on that old punching-bag, corruption."

As a result, we of this generation, who saw farm conditions at their worst in 1932, have had the happy privilege of seeing them over the last decade at their best. I am proud of the work my party has done in these twenty years to restore the American farmer to a position of equality and dignity in our national life. "

He has picked up these strange ideas from the men around him--bitter obstructionists who oppose these programs in Congress and who seek now to divert attention from the record with baseless, hollow warnings about iron-fisted regimentation, and a sinister government. In short, the General has fallen victim to the same old Republican oratory we've been hearing for the past twenty years."
5.45394795951354e-05,0.999945460520405,966_28,0,"That is our program. We take our stand upon the fundamental principle that the role of government is, to sum up, just this: To remove the roadblocks put in the way of the people by nature and by greedy men; to release the energies of the people, so that free men may work the miracles of the future as they have worked the miracles of the past.  No man could travel across our country, as I have done, without being deeply stirred. No man then--his heart touched and his mind moved--could but reflect upon his country's destiny, his love for it the greater as perils encompass it. As we walk through a troubled time, let us remember that the United States was born to greatness. "
5.32717467362665e-05,0.999946728253264,966_7,0,"Well, it is one of history's odd ironies that today the Republicans are accusing us Democrats of being enemies of free capitalistic enterprise--when the plain truth is that it was Democrats that saved the American capitalistic system under the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt.  Today America is more prosperous than any other nation in history. Of course, the Old Guard orators are going around the country these days broadcasting gloomy warnings that our prosperity is a fake, that it is based on war, that a depression will come with peace. This is nonsense. The truth is that our tremendous defense effort is holding us back, gobbling up the goods our people need at home, and when we have at last won through to safer waters, we shall be able to work at a hundred and one tasks that need doing. "
5.06952594754258e-05,0.999949304740525,976_16,0,"I would remind you that our present foreign policy--the policy of collective strength--began as a bipartisan foreign policy. It has been accepted by the best men in both parties. No amount of election year talk can obscure that fact. What the campaign has clearly brought out is that the Old Guard of the Republican party wants to scrap that bipartisan foreign policy--and that their candidate with the new look, the General of the Army, has either forsaken his own great past of becoming the policy partner of Senator Taft and some gentlemen of similarly eccentric views about our world."

It has been common knowledge, I thought, for a long time that the United States has been training and equipping Korean forces and that these forces are taking on more and more of the burden. I pointed this out some weeks ago and it has been frequently reported in the press over the past three years."

We must continue to meet the present urgent needs of the people. Too many Americans today dwell in misery in tenements in our huge congested cities--second-class citizens living in third class houses. Too many Americans still live in rags in sharecroppers' shacks. Too many Americans find that rising living costs are outrunning their pensions, social security benefits, life insurance proceeds and their salaries. The cost of living and wages have been chasing each other up and up in a dizzy, dangerous spiral of inflation that spells disaster for everyone. And we know what to do about that too, if the Republicans will just keep their hands off."

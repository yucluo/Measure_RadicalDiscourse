6.21250090538363e-05,0.999937874990946,1023_2,0,"My heart is very much in these programs because whenever you travel through this great land of ours, you can't help but see how much these programs have meant to so many people. Above all, our Democratic platform calls for action on the overshadowing problems of war and peace--the most important unfinished business of our generation--and I mean steady resistance to Communism and patient and persistent efforts to build a peace which has been man's dearest goal from time immemorial. Now, in these few words--if these were all that you knew about me and about our Democratic platform, well, I will have to confess that you wouldn't know very much for it is easy to get up here on a campaign train and say some nice sounding words, but out of our party you get a lot more than some high sounding words--you get first of all the record of twenty years of solid accomplishment, of accomplishment in the interests of all our people, and I hope you will compare this record with the Republican record before you vote--for, by the way, they have a record too during these past twenty years, and it is easy to sum up that record. Whenever there has been a forward looking, a constructive program to oppose, they have opposed it, and that is about all their record amounts to."
0.000258058140456316,0.999741941859544,1033_17,0,"But if we deal with this problem foolishly, we risk atomic war, on the one hand, or ignominious surrender, on the other--in either case, the destruction of freedom and civilization. I ask you: to whom should our people entrust the fight against Communism--to those Old Guard Republicans who, on one issue after another, vote the way our enemies like to see them vote? Or to those who have rallied the free world against Communist aggression?"
8.0825695228846e-05,0.999919174304772,1039_6,0,"I am frank to say we have had very little cooperation from some of the veteran's posts. They are awful keen about this law enforcement, but they continue to use all these devices in their own posts. So it is a little incongruous. They say, By gosh, we are going to clean up crime in this community and get those slot machines out of that corner saloon. But of course, as far as our Legion Post, or VFW, or whatever it is, that belongs to us and it is certainly a different situation. And after all, the device is set to give the fellow at least a sixty to a hundred chance of winning as against one chance in a hundred in the commercial device; and, after all, we own the machine, and it is not owned by a syndicate of operators and placed on a rental basis. And so on and so on."
6.30957823677844e-05,0.999936904217632,1074_2,0,"Then--then the people will vote on Tuesday. I understand that on Wednesday the newspapers plan to publish a Five-Star Final. Many thousands of our votes will come from rank-and-file Republicans who will vote with us. No doubt some Democrats will vote for the Republican candidates. We have already, for example, traded a couple of southern governors for the senator from Oregon and the vice chairman of the National Young Republicans. And I regard this as a profitable exchange for us. I would be happy to throw in a second baseman--but not Jackie Robinson."
6.57632223846403e-05,0.999934236777615,1085_15,0,"No, I've seen and heard the deep-throated courage and confidence and faith of strong men and women and happy children--people who still believe in one another, in spite of all the timid, doubting men. And I thank them every one for the reception they have given me--for their infinite courtesy and their heartening friendliness.  I have asked you for your support for my candidacy. I ask you now for support of our common faith in this country. The confidence we've inherited is our greatest wealth, the source of our strength. "
7.00675359852565e-05,0.999929932464014,1103_1,0,"My three days have carried me into quite a few corners of our country, so you may be interested in a few observations that I think are accurate. My first two days were spent in six southern cities. I was interested to see what were the subjects that seemed to interest them most, subjects involving national problems and the national scene, and then to compare those with similar reactions in the north. In my opinion they are identical."
6.3169231299555e-05,0.999936830768701,1108_0,0,"Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen:  If I cannot be heard in the roar I have no objection to your crying louder, but I do not want to put any more strain on these poor old vocal chords, that are unaccustomed to the kind and amount of talking I have been doing lately, than I have to.  It is a very, very great pleasure to be here with you this morning. Once before I visited the Republican National Headquarters, but under different circumstances and certainly in accommodations far less commodious than these."
7.06772384113081e-05,0.999929322761589,1114_3,0,"So, in all of our problems of the preservation of Constitutional forms, in the determination that Communism shall not take over our government, in the determination that Communism abroad shall not present to us an unbearable threat, let us remember this:  We are first of all defending the basic tenets of our Constitutional government that each man is a spiritual being created in the image of his God. Once we have gotten that thought in our minds so that we never forget it, ladies and gentlemen, we can clean out corruption.  Why, think of it, think of the votes we can roll up on November 4th.  We can bring down taxes; we can stop the terrific taxes that are piling up your prices.  An economist came into me the other day, one of these fellows, you know, that dig out the facts.  Every time you eat a boiled egg, unless you raise it yourself, you pay 100 taxes on that egg, one hundred taxes and then we wonder where the prices come from."
6.22917357858432e-05,0.999937708264215,1156_13,0,"No one, not even the blindest partisan, can call this a proud record.  At times the pitiless pressure of Communism has been checked by brave emergency attempts that rallied men of all parties to make up the deficiencies in our national leadership.  These attempts have produced the economic help of the Marshall Plan and the program of military aid to Greece and Turkey.  Both were enactments of the Republican 80th Congress, the Congress so long vilified by the administration.  These measures have helped to steady both the economic and the nervous systems of our allies.  They could hardly have been expected to do more in the making of our foreign policy.  Dollars and guns are no substitute for brains and willpower."
6.28737290931626e-05,0.999937126270907,1166_11,0,"In short the entire government will work for the good of 155 million people, not just for this group, for that group, but for all Americans.  Now, in this crowd, ladies and gentlemen, there are numbers of men who are my old comrades in arms.  Some of them may have fought in the Far Pacific; some may have had duties that kept them in the U.S.; many of them went abroad with me.  And I used to see those fellows along the roads, in the camps, sometimes at reviews, in their barracks, in their kitchen, wherever; and we used to talk about why we were fighting.  And we came to the agreement in simple terms that we were fighting to keep America the kind of land that we believe it to be--a land of freedom and opportunity, not a land dominated by a Hitler or by any group of bureaucrats.  The reason I am in this political campaign, my friends, is in a continuation of that promise.  I am trying to do my part to keep America the kind of country we have always known, which means first of all that you must have a government you can respect and other nations will likewise respect it because you do.  "
6.66665038974633e-05,0.999933333496102,1183_0,0,"Ladies and gentlemen: there is not much relationship between the military life that I led for forty-one years and the kind of campaigning that I am now doing, but every once in a while I am reminded of certain rules or maxims in habits from that life, and one of them was, Never allow yourself to be surprised.  I was told that the last stop at Grand Rapids, Now, this is where you say goodbye to Michigan.  And then as we came along, a couple of your finest salesmen from Kalamazoo said, We are going to slow up the train as you go through Kalamazoo and you wave at some people.  Then later they said, Now, we'll tell you what we want to do.  We'll stop there a second and you just go on out and say hello and go on with your work.  I'll tell you this; it's a funny kind of a slowing down and a funny kind of a way to a little neighborhood crowd.  I am completely flabbergasted and I am certainly honored."
5.90980658171275e-05,0.999940901934183,1197_13,0,"In Omaha the statements made in the Kasson speech in Minnesota were extended.  It is in the record as to what the Republican Party expects to do, purposes to do, with price supports, with REA, with cooperatives, with all of those things that mean so much to farm life today.  And that means perishable products as well as nonperishables.  So all of this talk about the Republican Party trying to put the farmer in the poor house is about as weak an argument as they could develop.  They say we want to abolish good times, that everybody will be out with a tin cup on the bread lines.  I made a talk the other night at Peoria where I took to pieces this so-called Democrat prosperity to show that the only advance in living standards the American people have made in the last 20 years was during the five years of World War II.  I do not believe that America wants a prosperity that is based upon the risks and sacrifices that men have to make in uniform against an enemy."
6.07064040550468e-05,0.999939293595945,1206_6,0,"We will find a better answer than setting up in this region a super-state, a valley authority set up and blueprinted in Washington, D.C. with all of its principal officials appointed from there. Another of those blanks is that the Republican leaders would like to abolish all the gains that labor has made through these last years since the beginning of the century.  Ladies and gentlemen, sheer bunk!  I am not going to take time this morning to outline what the Republican Party is attempting to do in establishing the kind of climate in Washington where the labor-management problems can be settled without strikes, but I am going to repeat just briefly the promise I made to labor on Labor Day.  I said something to this effect: that four years from now, if you people had decided this fall to establish a Republican administration in Washington in the Executive Department, in the Senate of the United States, and in the Congress, that the leaders of that group would hope to stand before a crowd like this at the end of those four years, and each of you could look at the other and honestly say, Those people were fair; they were just; they settled everything on the basis of what is good for the United States of America, not just some particular section or group whose votes they were trying to buy--what was good for the United States of America.  Moreover, they would say and you would say to each other, They protected the rights of all--labor, management, professional men, farmers, everyone.  And finally, you would say, And besides being fair and just, they were friendly.  They were just people who belonged to us, one of us, not a bunch of long-haired bureaucrats in Washington who wanted to rule our lives from 3,000 miles away.  That was the pledge I made and I make it everywhere I go."
7.05216187976688e-05,0.999929478381202,1213_8,0,"If we do that, ladies and gentlemen, then we are a truly religious civilization, marching forward under a firm leadership, a united leadership that is bound to bring us, first, peace in the world, greater prosperity at home, with that kind of distribution of that prosperity that allows every single loyal American of good will to work for the betterment of himself, his family, his community and America. I don't come before you, ladies and gentlemen, to make any long list of promises.  All the promises, the political promises, have been used up in the last 20 years anyway.  What I bring to you is a pledge, a pledge couched in the kind of thing that you people have a right to demand and expect of your government, that if you want to send the leaders of this crusade to Washington; they make this pledge now, they will above all things be honest; they will make it possible for all the agencies of the government that have the task of investigating--to make it possible for them to make their findings open to the public.  There will be no concealing of crookedness and dirt in the new administration."
9.46753059144732e-05,0.999905324694086,1220_40,0,"In this enterprise which I describe, we are not trying to remake the world in the image of America.  We are not trying to force any man to our way if it is not his.  We are not trying to buy peace or bring peace with the sword."
6.19709603041106e-05,0.999938029039695,1234_0,0,"Governor Barrett, I see there are some people around here who have the right idea. The first thing I find is a wash-rag and it says, Clean up with Ike. I have got, of course, many, many reasons for being pleased when I get out into this country.  Ever since 1919, friends of mine have been asking me out to fish and hunt, and it has been a grand country, but of course, I don't much chance, so I spend a great deal of time reading western stories.  One of the first ones I ever read was written right around here in this country.  I think it was written in Medicine Bow, Owen Wister's The Virginian."
7.007819409566e-05,0.999929921805905,1270_2,0,"In American single-talk, the threat amounts to this: First, the Russian Communist empire has recovered from the industrial and human destruction of the last war. Second, by skillful, aggressive, and ruthless prosecution of the Cold War, the Soviet Empire has added to its already great resources the important industrial complex of Central and Eastern Europe, and has added to its own large population six-hundred million human beings for use either as slave labor, or as expendable military masses."
7.57251747481103e-05,0.999924274825252,1285_30,0,And where are these bosses now and what are they up to?  They are where they have always been and up to the same things they have always been up to.  They are in the administration party and they aim to continue to rule it.
6.12457794081857e-05,0.999938754220592,1290_14,0,"Now, ladies and gentlemen, in concluding this short statement, I want to say this:  I do not come before you to engage in any competition of political promises.  This party in power in the last seven years has used up every possible political promise there is, and some of them have gotten pretty shopworn.  For example, there is no easier way to duck an issue than to say this, I will promise you a law, well knowing they cannot deliver it.  There is no easier way to get out of a situation.  What I promise you is work, never ending work, to make certain that justice is done.  So I cannot come before you with the competition of promises, but I do come before you with a pledge, and this is the pledge.  If you want to put this crusade at the helm of your government; if you want to substitute for these 22 caliber men who are trying to hold 45 caliber jobs the finest men and women that we can draw from all sections of this country, from every walk of life--and let me say plainly, based upon merit and without respect to color or creed; if you want to have a government of that kind, then you belong in this crusade."
7.30433088064908e-05,0.999926956691193,1296_0,0,"My friends of Nassau County:  Let me observe, first, that when the heart is full, the tongue is rarely glib.  So I am not certain what I shall say to you this morning.  I have just been traveling the roads of Nassau County, and never have I been greeted with more cordiality, with greater evidences of hospitality.  I am deeply grateful not only to everyone who was along the road this morning to wave a cheery hello, but to each of you here who has come out to allow me to bring a word of greeting and to express to you one or two of the thoughts on my mind as we go through his political campaign."
0.000141793198478446,0.999858206801521,1303_4,0,"The essential difference between this worn-out bureaucracy in Washington and the crusade is this:  They want to sit in Washington and direct your lives and your businesses and check up on you from thousands or hundreds of miles away.  We want to see you develop yourselves with every single thing you have got in you and hold the government ready to help you whenever it is necessary, but to work with you and not just to work you. We believe that if we bring to Washington the outstanding men and women of this crusade--your representatives, people coming right out of this crowd, men who have been introduced to you from this platform--that all of those people will be your guarantee that there is no crookedness in government, that subversion and Communism isn't getting inside of government.  They will be your guarantee that if a stray individual does go bad and betrays his trust, that kind of thing will be ripped out of government without delay."
7.03801661476097e-05,0.999929619833853,1304_4,0,"Just one or two items that are in this program of fear, and I will be on my hasty way through this section of New York state. They fear, they say, that these Republican, Independent and enlightened Democratic friends of mine will bring on a depression; that we may be able to lead the country toward peace, but if we do, there will be no jobs, men will be out of work, there will be breadlines--all that sort of bunk.  Now, the first thing that is necessary to lead our country toward peace is a strong America; and the first thing that means a strong America is an employed America--a prosperous America--that stands as an example of what free government can do for its citizens in this world.  That is the purpose to which this crusade is dedicated."
6.27786488331132e-05,0.999937221351167,1305_2,0,"You will notice that the state of Montana is the only one that has a Democrat governor, and we are going to change that next month. Let's hear briefly from each of these Western governors.  First, the able chief executive of Arizona, my very good friend, Governor Howard Pyle."
7.11471104096692e-05,0.99992885288959,1328_16,0,Their technique has been ingenious and ruthless. They have done on the infighting what they couldn't do in the open. They say they believe in public housing! But they put a declared enemy of public housing in charge of the public housing program.
7.55709073970143e-05,0.999924429092603,1366_26,0,"Mothers know about crowded schools and half-day shifts in many, many places. Farmers know what's happened to prices and costs and their diminishing share of the consumer's food dollar. The small businessman knows what's happened to his credit and his profits."
6.24590588439059e-05,0.999937540941156,1367_9,0,"And, you know, he said that Eisenhower had had another new idea--to wage peace not war. When he said that I blinked and thought again of Woodrow Wilson and the last-ditch Republican fight against the League of Nations. I thought of Franklin Roosevelt and the United Nations. I thought of the Truman Doctrine, and aid to Greece and Turkey. I thought of the Marshall Plan, Point 4, and NATO and the great Democratic struggle of a generation for peace, in which I am proud to have played a very small part myself. "
7.66290563199502e-05,0.99992337094368,1369_5,0,"When there was a strike at the auto agency of this Cabinet businessman his comment was: I don't happen to go along with some of the goons they've got running things. Is that what they think of labor? When small-business failures reach an alarming rate, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior says, There are business failures even in times of great prosperity. It is part and parcel of our American way of life... I do not think we would want it different. Is that what they think of small business?"
6.16351124778872e-05,0.999938364887522,1374_20,0,"The fact is that the Republicans, taking over the country at a high point of economic activity, have done nothing for such vital groups in the population as small businessmen and farmers--and have done less than nothing to prepare for the difficult problems of the future. The Eisenhower administration seems to have confused genuine friendship for business with snuggling intimacy toward a few of its giants. And meanwhile the big have gotten bigger and the small are disappearing."
7.31043515862976e-05,0.999926895648413,1378_35,0,What does Mr. Eisenhower propose then? That we go ahead with the development of the cobalt bomb to try to gain another advantage? A force that can shake the earth's axis.
6.13741710572801e-05,0.999938625828943,1391_15,0,"And distasteful as this matter is, I must say bluntly that every piece of scientific evidence we have, every lesson of history and experience, indicates that a Republican victory tomorrow would mean that Richard M. Nixon would probably be president of this country within the next four years. I say frankly, as a citizen more than a candidate, that I recoil at the prospect of Mr. Nixon as custodian of this nation's future, as guardian of the hydrogen bomb, as representative of America in the world, as Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces. Distasteful as it is, this is the truth, the central truth, about the most fateful decision the American people have to make tomorrow. I have full confidence in that decision."
7.81977827990996e-05,0.999921802217201,1398_34,0,"We cannot prove wise and strong by any such simple device as suspending, unilaterally, our H-bomb tests. Our atomic knowledge and power have forged the saving shield of freedom. And the future use and control of atomic power can be assured, not by any theatrical national gesture, but only by explicit and supervised international agreements."
8.93565359964385e-05,0.999910643464003,1401_35,0,"Where there was doubt, there is confidence. My friends, I believe that these facts plainly mark the path of our nation's progress. If you also believe this--if you want to keep on this way--then each of you must do your part to the full in making your decision clear and emphatic."
6.28600603168184e-05,0.999937139939684,1402_18,0,"In the meantime, wages have been raised and the cost of living has been extraordinarily stable in the last three years. It is true that you can say technically the cost of living is high. It has gone up 2.5 percent since we have been in, but it went up 45 percent or more in the last seven years of the preceding administration."
6.45997822092089e-05,0.999935400217791,1402_46,0,"THE PRESIDENT. Well, they propose to do plenty and are--well, I say are--not plenty, they are doing a lot and they expect to do more. Among other things, you know social security has been extended to many more people in the last couple of years--ten million more. We have gone into special housing programs for the aged. There has been special medical research in the diseases of the aged. There have been special programs started in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare so that the people that are chronically ill, although not acutely ill, could have proper hospital care or proper care within a hospital center. All of that kind of thing is being done and more will be done. But the great thing is, as I see it, to give them finally the income on which they can live in self-respect and dignity, even if they don't live quite as actively as they did when they were younger."
6.082101976559e-05,0.999939178980234,1417_1,0,"I should tell you that, in a very real sense, I am here today as president because of you, the people of Minneapolis and of Minnesota. Back in the spring of 1952, I was scrutinizing prayerfully my duties and responsibilities, trying to resolve my doubts as to whether there was any place or need for me in politics, and to settle in my mind and my conscience what I ought to do. At that time, the write-in vote in the Minnesota primary moved me far along the road to a final decision. Since that day, I have always felt a special kinship and relationship with you of this city and state."

In those lands, the fruits of imperialism are discontent, unrest, riots in one place and demonstrations in another, until the tyranny exercised over them either dissolves or is expelled. The day of liberation may be postponed where armed forces for a time make protest suicidal. But all history testifies that the memory of freedom is not erased by the fear of guns, and the love of freedom is more enduring than the power of tyrants. But it is necessary that the inspiration of freedom, and the benefits enjoyed by those who possess it, are known to those oppressed."

Now first of all, I feel great, largely because of the way you have greeted me. But tonight I am reminded, my friends, of the time when last we met here in the Garden four years ago."
6.18214791049818e-05,0.999938178520895,1430_10,0,"This, I maintain, is the difference between us. Now, through these past four years, there has been one subject that this administration has lived with, worked with, done more with, than any other and that is trying to develop and build the road to peace. Without peace, we cannot have these things that we have been enjoying the past four years.  We cannot have lowered taxes, we cannot have prosperity, we cannot have confidence among ourselves."
5.75961781572673e-05,0.999942403821842,1485_4,0,"How is it possible for us to maintain full employment at a time and in a decade when automation will become a byword? I lived with it for a month in West Virginia. I spent some time in McDowell County, West Virginia, which mines more coal than it ever did in history, more coal than any county in the United States, and has more people getting surplus packages from our government than any county in the United States. What is true of McDowell County and true of the coal industry will be true of other industries stretching across the United States. This is going to be a problem for the next president of the United States. These problems which I now discuss and mention, the problem of an abundant agriculture and an inability to distribute it effectively, all of these problems are so-called domestic problems."

I have a different office in Washington than you who work here in the city of Trenton, but I think that all of us who work for the government in one service or another, or all of us who work in other capacities, have a great and common interest in this campaign, and that is the advancement of the interest of the United States--to increase its power and prestige; to make it more secure; to make it possible in a dangerous world, when hazard surrounds us on every side, to make it possible for us to move safely ahead in a world of peace, protecting not only the security of the United States, but holding out the hand of friendship to all those who wish to be associated with us. Other Democratic presidents in this country--Woodrow Wilson, who served in this city, in this state, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman--all faced difficult and dangerous times. The election of 1932, I think, meant the preservation of freedom here in the United States. But I think the election of 1960 may well mean the preservation of freedom all around the globe."

The Senate is Democratic, and we could not mathematically lose control of the Senate. The House of Representatives is Democratic by a wide margin, and I doubt that the Democrats in the House of Representatives will lose control. Therefore, the prospect of four or eight years of a divided government, a government manned by a highly partisan figure, manned by a highly partisan party in the executive branch, and we have seen evidence of it in the last few days--how can we hope, at a time when we need action, how can we hope to possibly move ahead when on the one hand we say yes with the Democrats, and on the other hand we say no with the Republicans? The experience of the month of August in the Congress when both parties were vocally committed to great programs, housing, education, minimum wage, care for the aged--every program fell between the two opposing philosophies of the two parties."

Only ninety miles away stood the United States--their good neighbor--the richest nation on earth--its radios and newspapers and movies spreading the story of America's material wealth and surplus crops. But instead of holding out a helping hand of friendship to the desperate people of Cuba, nearly all our aid was in the form of weapons assistance--assistance which merely strengthened the Batista dictatorship--assistance which completely failed to advance the economic welfare of the Cuban people--assistance which enabled Castro and the Communists to encourage the growing belief that America was indifferent to Cuban aspirations for a decent life."

Their choice will be to move off dead center.  Their choice will be to move into the 1960s.  Their choice will be to assume the burdens and responsibilities of leadership.

Mr. Nixon may be satisfied when we build 30 percent less homes this year than last year, Mr. Nixon and the Republicans may be satisfied to defeat medical care for our older citizens, to prevent and fail to support better education for our children, to make it possible for every bright boy and girl to see the inside of a college and develop his talents. The point of the matter is that the Republican party and Mr. Nixon in his fourteen years of association with it have not stood for progress, have not stood for breaking new ground, have not stood for breaking new frontiers, and I believe in the 1960s, if the United States is going to fulfill its potential, if we are going to fulfill the destiny which is in store for us in the sixties, if we are going to be the leader of freedom, we are going to have to move here at home.  I come to Philadelphia and ask your help in this campaign.  This election is the means to an end, and the end is a great, stronger, and growing America.

Having seen him four times close up in this campaign and made up, I would not accuse Mr. Nixon of being barefaced, but I think the American people next Tuesday can determine who is telling the truth.  Mr. Nixon may tell us to forget the Republican party, he may tell us that he speaks for all the people, but I don't think the people of this state of New Mexico and the people of the United States are going to forget the record of the Republican party which he so well represents.

I could tell you that the way to get it is just to leave it to Washington, that Washington is going to provide the jobs and the schools and the progress we need, but that isn't the way it work in this country of ours.

Second, as far as the future is concerned, I would say that we can look at our experience, I cannot talk about mine.  That is your prerogative to judge that, but I can talk about my running mate's, and I say there's no man in the world today who has had more experience, who has done a better job of representing the cause of peace and freedom than Henry Cabot Lodge, our candidate for Vice President, at the United Nations."

Now, it would be presumptuous for me to say anything about who ought to be the next president.  It would be presumptuous for me to say anything about myself.  I have often thought this about my running mate.  I certainly think he's got it all over his opponent, but I can say something in regard to Pat, and this has nothing to do with regard to her opponent, because the ladies are not running against each other.

I know the people have spoken to me and they have said, Now Mr. Nixon, you say that you stand for more progress than your opponent does.  You stand for more progress in schools and health and education and welfare.  They say, How can you say this when he says he is going to spend more money for each of these programs than you do?"

But again, we don't stand on it.  How do I say that we can do this job?  Well, first, when you look at my colleague and I, we know Mr. Khrushchev.  We have sat down across the conference table with him.  We know that he is a man who is ruthless and tough.  We know that you must never make him a concession unless you get a concession in return.  That's why President Eisenhower was right in not doing what Mr. Khrushchev asked him to do again in the paper this morning, in not apologizing and not expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev as Senator Kennedy suggested he might.  That is why the next president of the United States must recognize that Mr. Khrushchev does not react like Mr. Nehru, he isn't like Mr. Adenauer, or Mr. Macmillan.  He is a man determined to conquer the world and so, first, we will keep America strong--the strongest in the world.  Second, we will see that the economy of this country moves forward so that Mr. Khrushchev never will be able to get through on his boast that he is going to catch us.  Third, we will see that we are firm, but we will never be belligerent, because we realize that while we hold the line for principle, we must always negotiate for peace, but never, again, making concessions, as I say, which don't get concessions in return."

Now, we stand not on this.  We do not say this is where we are going to stay.  We say that a record is not something to stand on, but something to build on, and we will build a better future."

They know  it.  They're going to pour in, without any question, hundreds of thousands of paid workers, in many instances.  I say hundreds of thousands.  That may be an exaggeration.  There certainly will be thousands of paid workers in some of the key industrial states.  They will be poured into this campaign.  We've got to combat them with volunteers, because that's all we have, but a good volunteer worker can always beat a paid worker, if he works, and so I say let's outwork them and outfight them in these last three weeks, and we'll win Arizona and the nation.

Now, the last thing I would say is this campaign has brought out the biggest crowds of any I have ever participated in.  I think it's probably the record.  Crowds from the standpoint of any campaign, including the ones in 1952 and 1956, are enthusiastic.

The reason why I stand for programs that will produce progress, but cost less, about $15 billion a year less of the federal government's money, and that's your money, is that I know what it means when the federal government spends more than it takes in.  I know the difficulty that literally hundreds of thousands, millions of families, are having meeting their obligations today.

Now we need a powerful military force but we also need to remember that the great foundation of this nation is based on the health of our people and the quality of our lives and the unity of our homes and our neighborhoods and our communities.

And I hope and pray, as you all do, that we can conduct our deliberations with a businesslike precision and a dignity befitting our responsibility, and the solemnity of the hour of history in which we meet. For it is a very solemn hour indeed, freighted with the hopes and fears of millions of mankind who see in us, the Democratic Party, sober understanding of the breadth and depth of the revolutionary currents in the world. Here and abroad they see in us awareness that there is no turning back, that, as Justice Holmes said, We must sail sometimes with the wind, sometimes against it; but we must sail and not drift or lie at anchor. They see in us, the Democratic Party that has steered this country through a storm of spears for twenty years, an understanding of a world in the torment of transition from an age that has died to an age struggling to be born. They see in us relentless determination to stand fast against the barbarian at the gate, to cultivate allies with a decent respect for the opinion of others, to patiently explore every misty path to peace and security, which is the only certainty of lower taxes and a better life."

I use me too in the grammatical, not the political sense. Which reminds me that there was a big meeting out here yesterday--a sort of bipartisan gathering with representatives from both branches of the Republican party. I don't know how the peace conference got along but they had a good time criticizing us for everything, as usual. They even accused me of the crime of visiting President Truman the other day--a crime that hasn't been committed since Rutherford B. Hayes, because the party in power has not nominated a candidate who was neither a member of Congress nor the Cabinet in seventy-five years. I thought I detected an explanation of their difficulty in finding something to say, however, when the orator of the day, Senator Nixon, revealed that out at the camp in Colorado, General Eisenhower's vacation headquarters, they ate fried mush most of the time.

You remember the bitter winters of 1930 and 1931. Farmers in Arkansas--conservative, law-abiding farmers--organized to march on towns and loot the stores. Children left home to spare their parents another mouth to feed; so many of them left that the railroads put on special open boxcars to keep the kids from breaking into the closed ones. Millions of American men and women waited in the breadlines. An army of ragged veterans actually marched on our national capital. "

What the campaign has clearly brought out is that the Old Guard of the Republican party wants to scrap that bipartisan foreign policy--and that their candidate with the new look, the General of the Army, has either forsaken his own great past of becoming the policy partner of Senator Taft and some gentlemen of similarly eccentric views about our world."

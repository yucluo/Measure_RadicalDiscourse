6.78731822565795e-05,0.999932126817744,1033_17,0,"But if we deal with this problem foolishly, we risk atomic war, on the one hand, or ignominious surrender, on the other--in either case, the destruction of freedom and civilization. I ask you: to whom should our people entrust the fight against Communism--to those Old Guard Republicans who, on one issue after another, vote the way our enemies like to see them vote? Or to those who have rallied the free world against Communist aggression?"
5.91561138126288e-05,0.999940843886188,1037_2,0,"Now, you know, I wouldn't say, my friends, that this proves conclusively that the Old Guard Republicans are really Communists, but I suppose if I were an Old Guard Republican I would, because that is exactly the way they argue. The great transformation which has overtaken our country in these twenty years has come about, in great part, because we have had a new spirit and a new purpose in our government--you could almost feel the change from confusion to confidence, from fear to faith, when the election of 1932 produced a great new leader, Franklin Roosevelt. And that was only the beginning of the process by which America began to lift itself out of the depths, both economically and spiritually, and onto a new plane of social responsibility and of decency. Government assumed responsibilities to avert economic catastrophe and to assure reasonable levels of security for the people. By doing this, great new energies within the people were unlocked. Of course, this new activity on the part of government aroused resentment. The Old Guard began raising their tired old refrain of socialism, and regimentation; you have heard these cries against every new idea in American history since the post office and the public schools."
6.94451439627152e-05,0.999930554856037,1038_9,0,"First, we must recognize that not alone for Americans, but for men everywhere, body and spirit are co-principals of the same being. Each needs a special sort of ministry. Let us remember that, while Christ preached the doctrine of eternal salvation, he also did the work that needed to be done in the kingdom of man. He healed the sick, fed the poor, sustained the weak, and sheltered all those who were in want. So must we, I think, as Americans continue prudently to extend to the needy of this earth that material help which we almost alone can give. And we ought to do this not grudgingly, but with a clear recognition that it is far better to give than to receive. In a word, the first answer to Communism is not a lesser, but a fuller application of Judaic- Christian ethics to the neighborhood of nations around us."
6.1172845881431e-05,0.999938827154118,1039_6,0,"I am frank to say we have had very little cooperation from some of the veteran's posts. They are awful keen about this law enforcement, but they continue to use all these devices in their own posts. So it is a little incongruous. They say, By gosh, we are going to clean up crime in this community and get those slot machines out of that corner saloon. But of course, as far as our Legion Post, or VFW, or whatever it is, that belongs to us and it is certainly a different situation. And after all, the device is set to give the fellow at least a sixty to a hundred chance of winning as against one chance in a hundred in the commercial device; and, after all, we own the machine, and it is not owned by a syndicate of operators and placed on a rental basis. And so on and so on."
5.89123520107813e-05,0.99994108764799,1047_1,0,"There is some very important business before our nation, as you all know, and it encourages me to think that these many groups we see all the time have a strong feeling we had better leave the management of our affairs in the hands of the Democratic party. And one reason for this is that it has become harder and harder instead of easier and easier to tell precisely what the Republican party stands for in this campaign. I confess it is early in the morning to be harsh about anybody and to be very critical of anybody. I don't want to be critical or harsh. I have in mind that we are now only a week from our election and we still don't know precisely what the Republicans propose to do about much of anything. We know where they stand on the matter of a new labor relations law, for example. That is precisely where they stood for the past five years. That is an old Republican position."
6.05714087048295e-05,0.999939428591295,1076_4,0,"     We are not only, as I say, a moral country.  This is a brave and a generous country, I think we are bearing our responsibilities well as the strong leader of the free nations against the threat of Soviet communism.  We are doing the hard job that must be done if we are to have a secure place for ourselves and for those children.  We are following out the high ideals of Woodrow Wilson, who wanted to take us our full part--give us our full part--accept our full responsibility for securing the peace back in 1920 after the first World War.  The American people didn't listen to Wilson in those days.  We turned instead to people who led us away from the hard road of international cooperation to the easy  path of isolation.  If we had listened to him we might well have avoided the terrible trial of the second World War, in which 300,000 of our young men died."
6.7549556921582e-05,0.999932450443079,1103_1,0,"My three days have carried me into quite a few corners of our country, so you may be interested in a few observations that I think are accurate. My first two days were spent in six southern cities. I was interested to see what were the subjects that seemed to interest them most, subjects involving national problems and the national scene, and then to compare those with similar reactions in the north. In my opinion they are identical."
6.85163682817568e-05,0.999931483631718,1127_31,0,"I will not support any amendments which weaken the rights of working men and women.  In seeking desirable amendments, I will ask the advice and suggestions of all groups--public, management, and labor.  And, gentlemen, I assure you that this invitation of mine will be genuine and in good faith.  It will not be one of those empty theatrical gestures so often made in recent years.  In my own mind I have complete confidence that this job of amending the law can be worked out so that no fair-minded member of your group will consider the results unreasonable.  No such legislation must ever be regarded as final, and in considering amendments to labor legislation, labor will have an equal voice.  It is the American way to take what we have and constantly seek to make it better."

A little sergeant--Sergeant Kuhlen--I will never forget his name as long as I live--came up with an idea.  He found that he could put some knives on the front of our tanks that would go in and cut off these hedges.  The tanks could come through straight and come through shooting, and it wasn't very pleasant for the Germans. "
6.19599988819853e-05,0.999938040001118,1155_2,0,"Ladies and gentlemen, the campaign in which I am now engaged is in conformity with the promises I made to those people.  I think that the administration in Washington has gone too far in damaging, indeed leading toward destruction of the kind of America we have known, loved and believe in.  That administration has not led us intelligently toward peace.  It is spending more than it earns.  Indeed, it earns nothing.  It is spending more than it takes from us in the highest taxes we have ever had, and leaves a deficit in the budget that further cheapens our money."
6.23649327221223e-05,0.999937635067278,1156_41,0,"It is true, of course, that the American taxpayer is burdened heavily by Soviet threat.  But what the Democratic nominee confessed was that under the present administration policy the American taxpayer is dancing to the Soviet tune and not getting for his tax dollar a clear, coherent plan to do away with the menace of war.  The telltale wording of that statement reflects the surrender of initiative to the Communists."
8.31361719627591e-05,0.999916863828037,1174_32,0,"The program I have outlined demands skilled and purposeful leadership. It demands harmony and understanding between the executive and legislative branches of our government. It will demand an end to what the Senate Preparedness Subcommittee has called abuse, misuse and disuse of power."
0.0111368852891608,0.988863114710839,1197_18,0,"As you know, the collector of internal revenue in one of our great districts is a high federal official.  Nine of them have been relieved for malfeasance or for cheating, or for something else wrong.  Some are behind bars--not long enough--but they are there because they lined their pockets with your money.  That has got to stop.  That is one thing that you don't have to stand for. "
5.92838562188266e-05,0.999940716143782,1206_6,0,"We will find a better answer than setting up in this region a super-state, a valley authority set up and blueprinted in Washington, D.C. with all of its principal officials appointed from there. Another of those blanks is that the Republican leaders would like to abolish all the gains that labor has made through these last years since the beginning of the century.  Ladies and gentlemen, sheer bunk!  I am not going to take time this morning to outline what the Republican Party is attempting to do in establishing the kind of climate in Washington where the labor-management problems can be settled without strikes, but I am going to repeat just briefly the promise I made to labor on Labor Day.  I said something to this effect: that four years from now, if you people had decided this fall to establish a Republican administration in Washington in the Executive Department, in the Senate of the United States, and in the Congress, that the leaders of that group would hope to stand before a crowd like this at the end of those four years, and each of you could look at the other and honestly say, Those people were fair; they were just; they settled everything on the basis of what is good for the United States of America, not just some particular section or group whose votes they were trying to buy--what was good for the United States of America.  Moreover, they would say and you would say to each other, They protected the rights of all--labor, management, professional men, farmers, everyone.  And finally, you would say, And besides being fair and just, they were friendly.  They were just people who belonged to us, one of us, not a bunch of long-haired bureaucrats in Washington who wanted to rule our lives from 3,000 miles away.  That was the pledge I made and I make it everywhere I go."
6.34068080032769e-05,0.999936593191997,1216_17,0,"Now, of course, with the expenditure programs that are required today for necessary purposes, there cannot be any escape for the moment from high costs and high taxes and high prices.  Which makes it all the more necessary that we watch with a jaundiced eye anything that is unnecessary--all of the waste, the duplication, the inefficiency that we know about, and which you would not expect me here today at this time to enumerate.  That must be eliminated and it is the second purpose of this crusade."
6.43702263698216e-05,0.99993562977363,1220_4,0,"Just north of where we are gathered tonight passes a historic line that encircles the globe.  This line is invisible in America, but in another land it is traced in blood.  It is the 38th parallel, the line which divides North and South Korea."
6.12607621099572e-05,0.99993873923789,1220_40,0,"In this enterprise which I describe, we are not trying to remake the world in the image of America.  We are not trying to force any man to our way if it is not his.  We are not trying to buy peace or bring peace with the sword."
6.15660597618112e-05,0.999938433940238,1241_7,0,"They fear, they say, that a new administration, not of the Fair Deal type, would take away all our social security programs.  Again, what rot!  All of us have gone up and down the country pledging not only the extension of those programs, but their correction, to make good the losses you have already suffered through inflation--in your bonds, in your savings accounts and in your pensions--and above all, to save whatever value still remains in the dollar.  At least, let's not let it go down from a present worth of 52 cents until it would be worth only twenty-five cents or less. "
5.9163560708727e-05,0.999940836439291,1246_8,0,"All of these costs and all of these expenditures would be bad enough if they were limited strictly to what they have to be, but when we have waste and carelessness piled on top of that, to the point where we are getting two airfields for the price of five, we simply cannot afford that luxury in this time of our history. Then, as if all of this were not enough, why do we have to have any vestige of subversion or dishonesty in our government--in high places and in low? Not long ago, a lady wrote me a letter.  She said, General, I should like to vote for you, but before I do will you promise me this:  That you will see that more of my tax money actually gets to Washington.  I wrote to her and said, My friend, a hard-working American taxpayer does not have to request that common woodshed honesty be observed by American officials in high positions.  That we can and should demand, and we don't have to ask for it."
5.92692156847279e-05,0.999940730784316,1266_7,0,"But finally and more important than that, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few weeks I have gone up and down the length of this land.  I have promised farmers that when they have problems, bring those problems to Washington.  If the United States chooses to place on me and my associates in this crusade the responsibility for conducting the national governmental affairs during the next four years, each of these problems will be solved only after complete consultation with the people affected.  I have made that promise and that pledge to farmers.  I have pledged that to labor.  On Labor Day I said, The pledge that this crusade makes you is this:  We would be firm, we would be just, we would be fair, but we will be friendly.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is what I should say that a new administration could do instantly on this problem.  Not only could they bring in advice, general advisors and consultants on the whole problem of promotion of small industries throughout our country, but they could bring in specifically, from this area people of management and business and investment and labor, the men who are working and out of work, bring them in and say, Let us find out what we can do here, what can the federal government do legitimately without interfering with your lives, but in a friendly, helpful sort of way that will both to the benefit of the federal government and to this city."

Let's hear briefly from each of these Western governors.  First, the able chief executive of Arizona, my very good friend, Governor Howard Pyle."
6.09990204583576e-05,0.999939000979542,1317_1,0,"I want also to express my admiration for the fine ticket for state and Congressional offices which our party has selected here in Massachusetts.  My friend Chris Herter has broad experience and a warm concern for people which fit him to be a great governor of your great state. I stand before you, tonight, in the solemn knowledge that--by this hour of the morrow--you may have summoned me to serve as president of the United States."
6.31070349797042e-05,0.99993689296502,1322_4,0,"I want to pay tribute, on the Labor Day, to the magnificent role that American labor, under the leadership of the AFL-CIO, has played in the world wide struggle with Communism. No agency, public or private, has been more effective in arousing the hearts and minds of the plain people of the Free World to an awareness of the menace. By its leadership in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, American labor has welded the free trade unions of every nation into a solid front against Communism."
7.03836562158478e-05,0.999929616343784,1322_8,0,"Yet the administration had opportunities to do something about this pledge. The AFL and CIO presented them with a golden chance to do just this when it called for an international convention against the use of slave labor. Here was a chance to place the United States in a position of active moral leadership, to mobilize the full force of world opinion against the Soviet institution of forced labor, and to establish our sympathy with the cause of these valiant workers behind the Iron Curtain who had risked their lives in the effort to throw off the yoke of servitude."
5.97355232043237e-05,0.999940264476795,1342_3,0,"Yet only a few weeks later he made his unhappy peace with the party. That was when he said, on October 30, 1953, that he favored the election of every Republican over every Democrat for every office any place. And that is the course he has pursued ever since. He has not hesitated to endorse any Republican, be he a Taft Republican or a McCarthy Republican. The only notable exception was an Eisenhower Republican--Senator Wiley of Wisconsin, for whom the President didn't lift a finger. It used to be said that Mr. Eisenhower would reshape the Republican party. You cannot help but wonder today who has reshaped whom."
6.76554107191691e-05,0.999932344589281,1347_21,0,"The magazines and newspapers, which denounce government intervention most lustily, are all subsidized by the U.S. Post Office--but that is not, it seems, legalized or even creeping socialism. Nor do airlines, for example, complain of the assistance they get as mail carrier. The private power companies--surely among the most active critics of governmental activity--have no objection to the billions of dollars worth of government financed and directed research, experiment, and pioneer construction which is being made available free to the private builders of atomic power plants. Nor has any private company blushingly returned its tax write-offs for accelerated plant construction on the grounds that it is robbing the citizens of their tax money."
6.22072635965655e-05,0.999937792736403,1351_15,0,"Words--empty words--have nowhere been so damaging and nowhere so cruel as in the Republican discussion of foreign policy. Those of Polish and Eastern European origin will remember particularly how the Republican orators--how Secretary of State Dulles--talked about liberation four years ago. This talk of liberation also had only one purpose. It was to win votes from the gullible by creating hopes of rescuing friends and relatives who lived behind the Iron Curtain. And they know now how cynical and empty that talk was. Instead of liberating anyone, four years later half of Indochina is gone and Soviet influence is spreading even in the political and economic field."
6.86071499338948e-05,0.999931392850066,1357_16,0,"The most obvious weakness, of course, is the ease with which our national forests, our wildlife refuges, our parks and streams, and public lands have been invaded and turned to selfish private purpose. But more important even than that, perhaps, is the shunting aside of men who are experienced and trained in a lifetime of conservation work, in favor of politician appointees. The agency that looked at tomorrow's needs for minerals has been disbanded--and nothing put in its place. The Soil Conservation Service has been weakened--and must be revived. We need the leadership that will look at the nation's needs for water, for areas of recreation in the great open country, for land, and forest, and streams. We need, in other words really to look together at the needs and resources of our common future."
5.93840344531079e-05,0.999940615965547,1364_8,0,"Does the President really object to his administration being called indifferent to unemployment? I remind him that his Secretary of Defense talked about workers out of jobs as kennel or hunting dogs, and that it was a White House assistant who said of unemployment this spring that the right to suffer is one of the joys of a free economy. And I want to say something, too, about another kind of indifference. I mean about the crisis in education in this country. The President said last night that twice in his State of the Union messages--in 1955 and 1956--he urged swift action--and that he even called a conference on education."
6.08868562759327e-05,0.999939113143724,1365_5,0,"And they are switching because now it is plain that the record of the present administration adds up to much fine talk, but no action, in meeting the problems facing the people of this country. They have failed to give the farmer a fair share of our national income. They have failed to take any effective action to build the schools our children need."
5.91051108590785e-05,0.999940894889141,1367_28,0,"What the Old Guard Republican leaders did to get their man in was to decide, coldly and with due calculation, that the personal popularity of one man was great enough that the general distrust of another wouldn't matter. They concluded, or rather they hoped, that enough voters would cast a ballot for one man's popularity without regard to the possible consequences if another became President. I think they were wrong. I think the people of this country do not view the vice presidency-- at least in these times-- as a casual incident. They know what the vice presidency is this nation's life insurance policy. They are going to read the fine print. And I don't think they are going to go for four years uninsured."

If that means anything, it means they should get parity without price supports. And if that is what Mr. Eisenhower meant, why didn't he say so four years ago? He didn't say so because he knew that any such statement would have cost him."

6.14737482883464e-05,0.999938526251711,1381_15,0,"Yet the Republicans sneer and call it nonsense and a theatrical gesture, even though we are now learning that the administration itself had been giving serious consideration to this same or a similar proposal. When I have suggested stronger, more efficient armed forces than the inefficient, expensive, and undemocratic draft system provides, they scream in unison that I'm trying to weaken our armed forces. Yet leaders of our defense services have been saying the same thing for months. And the Democrats in Congress have even forced the Eisenhower Administration to do more for our defenses than it wanted to."

This is our task, not only for those who are in the Congress and in the state gubernatorial chairs and in the legislatures.

In those lands, the fruits of imperialism are discontent, unrest, riots in one place and demonstrations in another, until the tyranny exercised over them either dissolves or is expelled. The day of liberation may be postponed where armed forces for a time make protest suicidal. But all history testifies that the memory of freedom is not erased by the fear of guns, and the love of freedom is more enduring than the power of tyrants.

I think in many ways the election of 1960 comes at a time more dangerous for our country, more trying for all of us, a period of greater responsibility for every citizen than any election since the election of 1860.  In that time, as you recall, the great issue was whether this country could stay united, whether it would, in the words of Lincoln, exist half slave and half free.  The issue in the election of 1960 involves not only the well-being of the people of this valley, involves not only the development of your natural resources, but as citizens of the United States and leaders of the free world, we must be concerned about such far-off places as the Congo, India, and Indonesia, the security of those countries, as well as the well-being of their people.

I spent some time in McDowell County, West Virginia, which mines more coal than it ever did in history, more coal than any county in the United States, and has more people getting surplus packages from our government than any county in the United States. What is true of McDowell County and true of the coal industry will be true of other industries stretching across the United States. This is going to be a problem for the next president of the United States. These problems which I now discuss and mention, the problem of an abundant agriculture and an inability to distribute it effectively, all of these problems are so-called domestic problems."

I think we need an administration which so regards it. We spend $42 billion on defense every year. Those ships sail the oceans. They protect us but they do not serve our people and the world. I do not regard the distribution of food around the world as a great burden upon us. I regard it as an opportunity, to use our assets in a way which will attract people to the cause of freedom. I am glad that this is our problem, and not starvation. I am glad we can produce more than we can consume, if we share it usefully, for we are our brother's keeper; and if we have great assets in this country, I believe we should hold out the hand of friendship. When hundreds of millions of people stagger through their lives searching for food and we have it, and we are trying to determine which way the world will go, I would rather see our food used in an imaginative way than to argue in kitchens or anyplace else. I want to help people and I want the United States to be identified with that cause as it was in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and Harry Truman."

But I want to say one or two things. I spoke this afternoon at the plowing contest on what I consider to be the number one domestic problem which the United States faces, and that is the sharp decline in agricultural income. I think the farmers of North Dakota and the farmers of South Dakota and of Minnesota and Montana have a very clear choice. The question is which party and which candidate can meet their problems in this state, and meet their in this country. They have heard from the Democratic party and they have heard from the Republican party. I remember when President Truman used to say that the farmers had themselves to blame for their difficulties because they voted Republican in 1952. But I don't hold that view wholly, because in 1952, the farmers were informed that the Republican party stood for 100 percent parity not once but at least three times."

And--at the same foreign ministers' conference--the United States suffered one of its few diplomatic defeats in the history of inter-American relations, when it was forced to withdraw its protest over Communist efforts in this hemisphere. This is a critical situation--to find so dangerous an enemy on our very doorstep.  The American people want to know how this was permitted to happen--how the Iron Curtain could have advanced almost to our front yard.  They want to know the truth--and I believe that they are entitled to the truth.  It is not enough to blame it on unknown state department personnel.  Major policy on issues such as Cuban security is made at the highest levels--in the national Security Council and elsewhere--and it is the party in power which must accept full responsibility for this disaster."

There are 15 million American homes, according to the last Bureau of the Census, which are substandard.  Mr. Nixon has issued a paper on housing, and this, I think, is most revealing of all and one of the most endearing qualities of the Vice President.  In his position paper issued in New York within the last three weeks, he says that the Housing Act of 1949 has worked very well, and do you know as a congressman he voted against it?  In that position paper he called for greater emphasis on middle-income housing and he voted against that in 1950.  He calls for a greater flow of housing credit so that the American people can buy houses at low rates of interest.  But he neglects to mention his vote as vice president to increase the interest rates on the GI housing bans.  High interest rates never built a single home and one of the reasons why we are building 200,000 less homes each year than we should to keep up with our population increase is because of the high interest rate policy of this administration.

So, first, because he is a man who understands power and respects it, because he is a man who will use power if he can get away with it, to accomplish his ends, we must make sure that he never believes he is strong enough and that we are weak enough that he could start something without risking national suicide on his own part. And, so, the first necessity of leadership in these critical years ahead is that the United States must continue to be what she is today--the strongest nation in the world.  And, my friends, we must continue to maintain that advantage that we presently have, and the next president must be prepared to ask the American people for whatever was necessary to maintain it because through that strength in our hands, we serve the cause of peace.

But let Americans never forget that we stand for something more than that.  Let Americans never forget that when we were a small nation and a weak nation 170 years ago, that we still were a strong nation in the minds of the world, because our ideals were strong.  What are they?  What do we stand for?  We stand for faith in God.  We stand for belief in dignity of every man, woman and child regardless of his background.

We say that history tells the American people that the way to progress is not to weaken the states and their responsibility, but to strengthen them.

We have sat down across the conference table with him.  We know that he is a man who is ruthless and tough.  We know that you must never make him a concession unless you get a concession in return.  That's why President Eisenhower was right in not doing what Mr. Khrushchev asked him to do again in the paper this morning, in not apologizing and not expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev as Senator Kennedy suggested he might.  That is why the next president of the United States must recognize that Mr. Khrushchev does not react like Mr. Nehru, he isn't like Mr. Adenauer, or Mr. Macmillan.  He is a man determined to conquer the world and so, first, we will keep America strong--the strongest in the world.  Second, we will see that the economy of this country moves forward so that Mr. Khrushchev never will be able to get through on his boast that he is going to catch us.  Third, we will see that we are firm, but we will never be belligerent, because we realize that while we hold the line for principle, we must always negotiate for peace, but never, again, making concessions, as I say, which don't get concessions in return."

I wan to talk to you about what I think are the three realities today in America.  These are the realities that we have simply got to deal with--not the general platitudes or general generalities, generous generalities or pious platitudes, but the realities.  What is it like?  What are the issues?"

For nearly four decades we have marched together in this country for the same goal:  a safer, a better, a more prosperous and a freer America and Americans, an America of equal opportunity where every individual can say not in defiance but in pride, I am an American and I am a man and I am proud to be a citizen of this great country.  Yes, yes, we march, we marched for Franklin Roosevelt out of the dark days of the Depression when he said that all we had to fear was fear itself and we marched right on through that Depression and America went on to win a great victory not only over a Depression, but in World War II and we marched with Harry Truman, who told it just like it was and he did something about it, too, for all of us, and we marched and we marched with John F. Kennedy who stood before you eight years ago and said these words to you:  I would like it to be said that in our administration, our country moved, but special emphasis on education, took care of our children and gave medical care to the aged and that we ended discrimination of all kinds in the United States.  He said, and I say, we want fair treatment for all Americans.  that is the Democratic program.  And, my friends, we have been marching to that  music, to Democratic administrations, and we passed Medicare and more aid to education to help our children than any other administration in the history of this country and we passed more civil rights legislation and we have done more for our job training and more opportunity than any political party or any administration.  That's why we are proud to be Democrats.  And you can tell your grandchildren that you were there when America awoke from eight years of fitful sleep, the great GOP slumber, and moved forward once again under Kennedy, under Johnson, and now under Humphrey and Muskie.  Yes, Mr. Nixon says, and now listen to what he says, because really it's hard to understand what he says.  It's a little confusing.  Listen to what he says.  He says, If you elect Hubert Humphrey, it will be more of the same.  And you know, that fellow is beginning to tell the truth.  It's new Nixon when it comes to that.  And, by the way, friends, don't worry about the new one, don't even worry about the old one; what you've got to worry about is the real Nixon.  That's the one you got to worry about "

And then in addition, there are the state and local development programs and the enormous resources in the private sector.  Add them all up and we ought to be able to renew our rivers, cleanse them, so that your children can swim in them and that the fish can come from them and that you can enjoy an afternoon alongside of them.

I want to point out that the achievement before us today was possible because of many.  I have mentioned some of the early pioneers, and particularly possible because of the representation from the States of Washington and Oregon.  Those states were represented brilliantly in the nation's capitol and some of the most respected and effective statesmen and women of our times are present here on this platform:  Senator Warren Magnuson, Senator Wayne Morse, your own beloved Senator Scoop Jackson, Congresswomen Edith Green, and Julia Hansen, and Catherine May, Congressmen Al Ullman, Tom Foley, Lloyd Meeds, Brock Adams, Floyd Hicks.  These, and there may be others, are all responsible for, in part for what has happened, because as it was noted, it takes time and it takes perseverance.  And I am happy to say that in my 16 years in the Senate, I do not recall a single time that I ever voted against a development project for our rivers.

Well, none of that's taken place. And while I was there, a man stood in front of me--middle-aged, black, not antagonistic at all, and with no bitterness--but just with a longing in his voice, said to me, Can you tell me that I can have hope? That I can look forward to, once again, taking care of my family, providing for my children? Well, how do you answer that? You can have hope, though. I still have faith in the people of this country--and out there, on the countryside, I didn't see anything to shake that faith. We can do what has to be done. These unemployed can have their jobs back, but we can't live in a dream that it's just going to happen overnight. That eight million unemployed are going back to work, that inflation is better than 12 percent when four years ago it was only 4.8 percent is suddenly going to disappear."

Let it always be clear that we have no dreams of empire, that we seek no manifest destiny, that we understand the limitations of any one nation's power.

We saw great sights today coming in here, rolling hills and golden cornfields, vivid proof of why our great nation is the most bountiful and special place on the face of the Earth.

Because of what you did--and many of you today--in Desert Storm, we are the most respected nation on the face of the Earth. And don't let him tear down America. Don't let him tear it down. Because we had the courage to stand for freedom, the world today now holds unprecedented opportunity. We've got to be ready for it.

We are opposing it at home where its agents and converts seek to undermine our society and corrupt our government. As I have repeatedly said, the federal government must use all its resources to expose and identify Communistic activity, to keep Communists out of places of responsibility in our society, and to protect our institutions from Communist espionage, sabotage and subversion.

Youngstown was not, in 1932, a pleasant place to work or to live--and Youngstown was typical of most of the cities of America. The steel mills here in the Mahoning Valley were working at 31 percent of capacity. One Youngstown working man out of every three was unemployed. There was no unemployment compensation. The other two men worked at poverty wages. There was no minimum wage law. Those men worked in silence beside the furnaces. There was no collective bargaining act. The foreman's word was law. The working man had no seniority rights in his job and there was almost no collective bargaining contracts; almost no unions. At the end of life's work when you could no longer work, there was nothing. There was no social security. You only knew that one day--and you never knew when--there would be a pink dismissal slip in your envelope, and that would be all. If it was bad at the mill, it was infinitely worse in the street and in the home. Youngstown was one of the first cities to start soup kitchens. So desperate indeed did the city of Youngstown become that the City Council..."

5.69290277764952e-05,0.999943070972224,1039_3,0,"Mr. Chairman, I just happened to run across one thing that a group was doing in some town in Illinois which is illustrative of what I mean by the variety of possibilities. They were merely beautifying the state highway at the access point of the city, where it began to come into the city. And where it had been shabby and ugly and messy they were cleaning it up around there and developing a picnic area--that sort of thing--and an infinite variety of things. Also, of course, from the point of view of the public official, it is a wonderful access point to communities."
5.53724500788599e-05,0.999944627549921,1074_2,0,"Then--then the people will vote on Tuesday. I understand that on Wednesday the newspapers plan to publish a Five-Star Final. Many thousands of our votes will come from rank-and-file Republicans who will vote with us. No doubt some Democrats will vote for the Republican candidates. We have already, for example, traded a couple of southern governors for the senator from Oregon and the vice chairman of the National Young Republicans. And I regard this as a profitable exchange for us. I would be happy to throw in a second baseman--but not Jackie Robinson."

It is a record of opposition and harassment for 20 years, not only on price supports, but on all of the other Democratic programs on the storage program, rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, rural electric coops and so on.  The Republican Old Guard has never understood the philosophy behind these programs; it has never understood the programs themselves; it has never understood how they work.  The warning is plain; the Old Guard is hoping that the General can make his easy promises to farmers so convincing that they will forget about their own voting record."
5.8483777110339e-05,0.99994151622289,1083_5,0,"Democratic administrations have fought to bring these things to you, not because that would win votes, but because they were right and just and fair.  And we are going to continue to shout and do what we think is right to extend the gains that we have made here at home, and to fight for peace abroad. In the conduct of our foreign affairs we will suffer no tyranny over us, just as we will suffer no tyranny of one American over another.  We want to impose no tyranny on any other people.  We will remain free ourselves--more so.  We will find, as we have found before, the balance between the power we generate and the brakes that will check the power of those hostile to us.  In this way we can move in the wide open world as our fathers did when our nation was founded, and we can move unafraid.  I am reluctant to stop, although I have talked entirely too much, both here and all throughout this campaign.  All the same I have left much unsaid that is in my heart.  All I can do now is to thank all of you and, through you, thank all Americans for the privilege of your attention in these past months."
5.95675710762032e-05,0.999940432428924,1095_6,0,"The next thing we must do is remember this:  There are many group tasks that must be done by us in our families, in our communities, in our states, and finally in the nation.  Lately it seems to be too much in the nation.  We do these things together because no one can do them for himself alone.  We must approach those group problems with a spirit of cooperation, a readiness to accept the responsibilities of each of us which are group in character.  If we do not do that then there comes that creeping tide of central law that finally results in the all-powerful state, and we do it because we are regimented.  Let us do our jobs at home, first in the family, then in the village, then in the state.  Let's not let the central government get any more of them than we have to."
5.58512789852205e-05,0.999944148721015,1150_1,0,"I had a wonderful story told me about your town, that only last August in the midst of carrying on your fair you had a great storm that destroyed the buildings and tents and it looked like it was going to be disaster and no fair.  You people pitched in on your own.  You didn't even wait for a Washington bureaucrat to come down and do it.  You did it yourselves.  Moreover, I am told what you could expect in that little incident, that the elephant stayed on the job working until the last and the donkey played out--just too old, too tired."

We stopped the shooting war in 1945 the strongest military nation in the world, to say nothing of our academic strength and our spiritual, intellectual, scientific and moral strength.  We were the greatest military nation on the globe."
5.69269377014175e-05,0.999943073062298,1206_6,0,"We will find a better answer than setting up in this region a super-state, a valley authority set up and blueprinted in Washington, D.C. with all of its principal officials appointed from there. Another of those blanks is that the Republican leaders would like to abolish all the gains that labor has made through these last years since the beginning of the century.  Ladies and gentlemen, sheer bunk!  I am not going to take time this morning to outline what the Republican Party is attempting to do in establishing the kind of climate in Washington where the labor-management problems can be settled without strikes, but I am going to repeat just briefly the promise I made to labor on Labor Day.  I said something to this effect: that four years from now, if you people had decided this fall to establish a Republican administration in Washington in the Executive Department, in the Senate of the United States, and in the Congress, that the leaders of that group would hope to stand before a crowd like this at the end of those four years, and each of you could look at the other and honestly say, Those people were fair; they were just; they settled everything on the basis of what is good for the United States of America, not just some particular section or group whose votes they were trying to buy--what was good for the United States of America.  Moreover, they would say and you would say to each other, They protected the rights of all--labor, management, professional men, farmers, everyone.  And finally, you would say, And besides being fair and just, they were friendly.  They were just people who belonged to us, one of us, not a bunch of long-haired bureaucrats in Washington who wanted to rule our lives from 3,000 miles away.  That was the pledge I made and I make it everywhere I go."
5.77875238469153e-05,0.999942212476153,1210_2,0,"First of all, of course, corruption is an expense piled onto all of the necessary expenditures that you people must bear.  By this I mean the actual cost in dollars is something that you have to add onto all these wasteful and extravagant expenses, as well as the necessary expenses.  But the great damage done to us by corruption in government is, after all, not just the few dollars it takes out of our tax revenues and our pockets.  This mess in Washington lowers our prestige abroad and robs us of pride in our own government.  If we are going to restore pride in government, who is going to do it?  You can't take an organization that has been in power far too long and merely by doing a little face-lifting job, doing a little repaint job, get by with it.  Actually, I believe that the administration candidate said all it needed was a little refreshening.  But as far as I am concerned, how do you refreshen a bad egg?"
6.02306800887857e-05,0.999939769319911,1222_3,0,"If on top of that we have the military force we need then we are strong.  But how will we do all those things?  We will do them ladies and gentlemen only if we are a united people, united behind the great aspirations and purposes of our government.  And right there is the crux of the matter.  You must have a government that you trust, respect and believe in, if you are going to have a united United States.  A united United States would be a strong bulwark of peace.  A united strong United States can lead the free nations of the world into that kind of collective security program that will lift a great burden from our hearts:  the burden of fear abroad."
5.82692293269966e-05,0.999941730770673,1233_24,0,"The Republicans have not only participated in every one of our enlightened farm programs, protection of farmers against disasters where they can't protect themselves, but they have pledged this:  When it comes time in the future to begin to study these programs and how we adjust them to changing and future conditions, farmers will be brought in and farm leaders will be brought in.  They will be consulted, and not the way they are consulted now:  You do this or you will get no more.  They will be consulted on what is the problem of their locality.  We have no intention in this crusade of getting a bunch of long-haired Brannan experts to come out and run your farms.  We figure you can do it a little better."
5.51019887385667e-05,0.999944898011262,1234_0,0,"Governor Barrett, I see there are some people around here who have the right idea. The first thing I find is a wash-rag and it says, Clean up with Ike. I have got, of course, many, many reasons for being pleased when I get out into this country.  Ever since 1919, friends of mine have been asking me out to fish and hunt, and it has been a grand country, but of course, I don't much chance, so I spend a great deal of time reading western stories.  One of the first ones I ever read was written right around here in this country.  I think it was written in Medicine Bow, Owen Wister's The Virginian."
5.43827907304367e-05,0.99994561720927,1249_17,0,"There is a cruel duplicity involved on the part of an administration which has pledged social security for some, and then through waste and careless financial policies, has caused an inflationary insecurity for all. And now we come to another glaring example of our national leadership's failure to live up to high ideals.  I refer to the McCarran Immigration Law, which was passed over the president's veto at the last session of Congress.  A new immigration law was certainly needed.  But with leadership, rather than vetoes, we should have had, and we must get, a better law than this McCarran Act."
6.01313386635363e-05,0.999939868661337,1266_7,0,"But finally and more important than that, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few weeks I have gone up and down the length of this land.  I have promised farmers that when they have problems, bring those problems to Washington.  If the United States chooses to place on me and my associates in this crusade the responsibility for conducting the national governmental affairs during the next four years, each of these problems will be solved only after complete consultation with the people affected.  I have made that promise and that pledge to farmers.  I have pledged that to labor.  On Labor Day I said, The pledge that this crusade makes you is this:  We would be firm, we would be just, we would be fair, but we will be friendly.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is what I should say that a new administration could do instantly on this problem.  Not only could they bring in advice, general advisors and consultants on the whole problem of promotion of small industries throughout our country, but they could bring in specifically, from this area people of management and business and investment and labor, the men who are working and out of work, bring them in and say, Let us find out what we can do here, what can the federal government do legitimately without interfering with your lives, but in a friendly, helpful sort of way that will both to the benefit of the federal government and to this city."

I spoke of the undying hate of Communism for our American way of life.  There is no question that we are marked as Communism's final and greatest victim to be."
5.61125740202352e-05,0.99994388742598,1270_17,0,"We must call upon the best minds of our nations to sit down with political and economic leaders of other nations to find solutions to the crucial problems of international economic policy.  I believe that the wrecking of the London Economic Conference of 1933 was one of the great, though little understood, tragedies of our modern world.  We must make a fresh start."

I hear that more than twenty-thousand people contributed their funds to make this hall possible.  Whenever anything comes to my attention that involves veterans, I, like most other old soldiers, want to reminisce a bit.  Never do I get tired of reminiscing about the heroism, the sacrifices, the devotion to our country of the millions of men and women who made up our fighting forces in World War II.  I am really proud that the city of Johnstown has chosen to take a building such as this that will be used by your citizenry through the years to make it a lasting useful memorial to their services."
5.52265856691888e-05,0.999944773414331,1300_38,0,"A: You know, fortunately, Mr. Nagel, this morning there was a very significant item in the paper. It was this: There was quoted a top-secret document of the American Defense Department. How it got there, we will never know probably. But that top-secret document brought out one fact that really answers your question. It was this. There was a military estimate made in September 1947 by military men, and it had this conclusion: The military occupation of South Korea is not essential to the military security of the United States of America."
5.52912701346198e-05,0.999944708729866,1308_18,0,"Ladies and gentlemen, already I have been notified by my associates in front of me that I have used up far more than my time.  I do want to thank each of you who has come out here this morning and given me this time from his busy day not only to bring him a greeting but to allow me to express a few of these thoughts that are on my mind as we go through this political campaign.  I haven't anything in shopworn promises to offer you, but I do tell you this:  When this campaign started and we had some smoothly flowing, high sounding language from the opposition as to what they were going to do--I made a pledge."
7.32610939717904e-05,0.999926738906028,1309_6,0,"Then suddenly, they had a new one.  They feared I was a bigot.  I was terrible.  I hated everybody who hadn't been born ten generations back in the United States, and they thought I didn't know any American Indians, so this looked like a pretty good one.  They said I was anti-Catholic, anti-Negro, anti-Semitic, anti-everything.  Well, that one I didn't have to answer, my friends.  I am very proud of the fine friends of all those groups who jumped into the public print and into the headlines and said, That is just a plain lie, because we know he is not."

Is that what they think of labor? When small-business failures reach an alarming rate, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior says, There are business failures even in times of great prosperity. It is part and parcel of our American way of life... I do not think we would want it different. Is that what they think of small business?"

I would hope that all of us would cherish that ideal--that all of us would remember that the perception of truth is more important than which party wins the election. It is only in this spirit that I could ask for your support today--in an unlimited faith in the people, and in an unlimited conviction that the truth will prevail."

And only last Sunday--just four years ago--Mr. Dulles said in a television interview that the United States, Britain, and France have developed a common policy, and I think it's amazing the degree to which we have had a common policy... and the fact that there are certain minor superficial difficulties as to details about just how you handle tolls, or how much is going to get paid to Egypt and how much isn't, doesn't detract from the fact that we have a common policy. The superficial difficulties of Sunday became pretty formidable by Tuesday, when Britain and France broke with the United States in the U.N."

Now, national health, the proper education of our children, and the human welfare of all Americans are discussed at the same table--and with the same exhaustive care--as such great subjects as foreign affairs and national security. The men of the opposition know perfectly well that one of the main reasons they were thrown out of office four years ago was their tolerance of the thievery of inflation. Just in the final seven years of their tenure of office, this economic fever had cut the value of the dollar by almost one-third, damaging the livelihood of the aged--the pensioned--all salaried workers. The opposition did nothing effectively to stop this economic thievery. And they know it."

We believe, with the Constitution, in the equality before the law of every single American. In making this a reality in this day and time, we believe in cooperation.

But I want to say one or two things. I spoke this afternoon at the plowing contest on what I consider to be the number one domestic problem which the United States faces, and that is the sharp decline in agricultural income. I think the farmers of North Dakota and the farmers of South Dakota and of Minnesota and Montana have a very clear choice. The question is which party and which candidate can meet their problems in this state, and meet their in this country. They have heard from the Democratic party and they have heard from the Republican party. I remember when President Truman used to say that the farmers had themselves to blame for their difficulties because they voted Republican in 1952. But I don't hold that view wholly, because in 1952, the farmers were informed that the Republican party stood for 100 percent parity not once but at least three times."

Roosevelt, who was running in 1920 for the vice presidency of the United States, with Governor Cox of Ohio.  Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt then journeyed to Washington, D.C., and went to see Woodrow Wilson, sick, aging, and at the end of his career.  After Woodrow Wilson talked for a few minutes however, with great feeling and great fire of his desire for a unified world and a world of peace, Governor Cox broke in and said, We are behind you 100 percent, and they fought that campaign in part to implement the ideal of Woodrow Wilson for the establishment of the League of Nations, and lost.  But Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt, in losing that election in 1920, held before themselves and the people their concept of the service that they can render in an election, of attempting to turn the attention of the people to the great issues that face us, and the great possibilities that lie in action in the future.  And I believe in this election 40 years later, we merely do not run for office, but we also seek to establish a basic point, that what this country is now doing is not good enough, that in the 1960s, if we are going to maintain our freedom, if we are going to meet our commitments at home and abroad, we have to do better, and that is the basic issue which has separated Mr. Nixon and myself.

He and I are graduates of the Al Smith school of dinners of last night.  The Vice President claimed Al Smith for his work in his latter years and I claimed him for his work in the 1928 campaign.  Neither one of us indicated what Al Smith would do in 1960.  It is possible he would have voted Republican but I think he would have prayed Democratic this year."

There are now within the department of state certain studies and certain polls which have been made of our position overseas.  The state department has been reluctant and unwilling to release them, even though they have been paid for by the taxpayers of the United States, and even though the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Fulbright, has asked that they be made public, for our information.  Mr. Nixon said that he had no objection, and I will quote him: He would have no objection to making them public.

Now, this morning the papers reveal, and I have the New York Times in my hand, that the Information Service of our state department has been conducting polls throughout ten countries of the world to try to find out their view of the United States.  These polls have been confidential, but the papers evidently got hold of them.  Here is what the headline says, and it really goes to the whole issue of this campaign: The U.S. Survey Finds That Others Consider the Soviet the Mightiest.

It indicates his belief that we are moving in a period now, to quote him, of unparalleled prosperity, that the United States is moving in a position of strength and vitality, and that everything that must be done is being done in good measure.  He looks around the world and he sees the United States with our prestige at an all-time high, and that of the Communists at an all-time low.  I look at the world and I look at the United States, and I don't see his picture at all, and I am not, as the Democratic candidate for office, going to run for the presidency in 1960 with any belief or any view that it is worthwhile getting elected president if we have to run on a platform which is totally unrealistic.  This country is not moving ahead like it is going to have to move ahead if we are going to meet our responsibilities to ourselves, to those who come after us, to those who look to us around the world for leadership.  And our position in the world is not unparalleled; our prestige has been higher.  Our strength relative to that of the Communists has been greater.  If Mr. Nixon hopes to be president of the United States and present the United States to the world in the same image that he now presents it in this campaign, I could not disagree with him more.  I hope you share the view with me that we want the truth with the bark off.  The people of the United States want to face the facts.  You share the same view that I do, that this country's potential is unlimited.  There is no responsibility, no burden, no hazard that the United States cannot meet, but it certainly cannot meet those hazards unless the leadership is prepared to tell the truth.  "

Well, why didn't we?  Why did we wait until this summer?  The new continent now, which will bear great influence in the world, is Africa.  Do you know that we brought more foreign students to the United States ten years ago than we do today?  Last year, Guinea asked for 500 teachers.  Do you know how many we sent them?  One.  Do you know there are more students studying here from Thailand than from Africa south of the Sahara?  Do you know that we are about fifteenth or fourteenth or in the world in radio programs to Africa, that we are behind Indonesia?  Do you know that we are fourth in the world behind Radio Cairo in our radio broadcasts from the United States?  Do you know that the Soviet Union spends ten times as much as we do in Spanish broadcasts to Latin America?  This administration is experienced?  I don't think any judge would give a man who had forty accidents a new driver's license.  I don't think an administration which has presided over three recessions in the last eight years, which is now presiding over the lessening of the U.S. position around the world, which has permitted the U.S. image to fade as a vital society, our most important asset, which has in that way damaged the cause of freedom, I cannot believe that any young man or woman who looks to the future can possibly decide to sit down and sit still and look back with Mr. Nixon and the Republican party which has always opposed progress."

First of all, let's recognize a fundamental fact. You hear a lot of talk about the farm problem these days, and from a political standpoint it's a difficult one. But let's never forget that there is no greater asset that we have in our struggle with the forces of slavery than the tremendous incredible productivity of America's farmers. Mr. Khrushchev knows this. He told me when he got back to Washington that he was pretty impressed with what he saw on the farms in Iowa that he visited, and he has reason to know it and I'll tell you why: because here in the United States approximately 6.5 million farmers and farmworkers produce as much as 50 million farmers and farmworkers produce in the Soviet Union. That, you see, gives us a tremendous advantage which we must retain. But since we owe this to our farmers, we must see that our farmers get what they do not receive today, and that is a fair share of America's increasing prosperity, and this can be done. The problem is difficult. As I've indicated, I'm going to touch upon it in detail in Iowa on Friday and a speech in South Dakota at the national plowing contest the next night."
6.01107276522392e-05,0.999939889272348,1755_1,0,"Some of you know that for several months I have been making a careful study of the situation confronting our farm people, and in the process have met with the most knowledgeable and objective-minded people I could find.  What I want to do today is to talk over with you some of my views based on this serious study. At the outset I would like this point clearly understood: the problems of farm people ought not be approached, as far too often has been the case in the past, as something to exploit for political advantage.  Rather, the approach has got to be objective, and has got to be constructive.  In a determined effort to find a solution, the good of the farmer, not the good of politicians, has to be our steady purpose if we are ever to get anywhere."

But all the critics didn't think that.  There were others who said, It wasn't a case of the President not answering insult for insult.  There were some who said, The President should have taken a different line.  They said, for example, that he should have tried to save this conference, that he might have expressed regrets, for example, for these flights and maybe that would have saved it."
5.76655350190845e-05,0.999942334464981,1776_21,0,"First, for the record: there has been a lot of criticism of President Eisenhower's leadership in the field of foreign affairs, but, my friends, they pay off on the results, and in seven and a half years this is what he has done: he's ended one war; he's kept us out of other wars, and we have peace without surrender today--and I think the American people want that and they like it. Second, as far as the future is concerned, I would say that we can look at our experience, I cannot talk about mine.  That is your prerogative to judge that, but I can talk about my running mate's, and I say there's no man in the world today who has had more experience, who has done a better job of representing the cause of peace and freedom than Henry Cabot Lodge, our candidate for Vice President, at the United Nations."

I'll tell you why.  Because we know him.  We know the Communists.  We sat opposite the table with them.  We know what they're trying to do.  Here are fanatical, ruthless men who are determined to conquer the world, determined to conquer it by any means, if necessary.  But when we consider them, then, we've got to recognize that they're going to cause us trouble--they're going to cause us trouble every time they can.  They're not going to cause us trouble only if we do what they want us to do.  And that means turn over the world to them."

I know the people have spoken to me and they have said, Now Mr. Nixon, you say that you stand for more progress than your opponent does.  You stand for more progress in schools and health and education and welfare.  They say, How can you say this when he says he is going to spend more money for each of these programs than you do?"
5.66911716662478e-05,0.999943308828334,1787_9,0,"Now, talking to that point for a moment, naturally, you have to assume I'm a little prejudiced on that point, but I want to point out that my colleague, Cabot Lodge, and I, begin with a record, and you must hold us accountable for that record.  For seven and a half years we have been part of the Eisenhower administration.  We have sat in the Cabinet, in the Security Council.  We have participated in the discussions leading to the great decisions on Lebanon, Quemoy, and Matsu, and others with which you are familiar."

It is tremendously rich.  The British have prepared it--as the Congo was not prepared, unfortunately--for independence.  We hope and we trust that it will be able to develop its independence.  And I hope and I trust that the people of New York with all of the greatness of heart which they've always shown will give him a magnificent welcome here.  I hope that they do it because--I want to tell you what happens to Africa, my friends, affects us in America.  It affects us in Europe, the Middle East, in Asia."

We have a great humanitarian concern, and one of the reasons that we have developed this concern is because of the contribution made by people that make up the mainstream of American life.  Who are they?  They came from all the countries of the world.  Warm-hearted Italians, people from Europe, from Asia, from Africa, these are Americans.  And because America is the whole world, America will always have a feeling and a concern for misery and hunger and want in the whole world."
5.57591071458967e-05,0.999944240892854,1792_11,0,"And, I say that as far as the American people are concerned, while this is a kind of a program that is not one the demagogues will be pleased with, it is one that will bring to the people the increase in their progress, and the increase in jobs and job opportunities that every American wants.  And that's the way to get it, and not through just sending it down to Washington to create the jobs through what Washington spends. There was another point that I would make.  I make it here recognizing that most of the people in this great audience are those that have had rare opportunities.  You have had the chance to go up in your communities, to go to school.  You have not suffered from discrimination or prejudice, the great majority of you.  And the reason I mention it to you, the reason that I think it's particularly appropriate to say it here is because I don't know of any man in this country who at the state level, and who also in his life, has done a more effective job, or one who has believed more deeply than Governor Nelson Rockefeller in the field of creating equal opportunities for all of our people.

If you want higher taxes, if you want higher prices, you have a pretty good choice and a pretty good way to get them.  No, I say, we can have progress and that we will have it, but that the way to get it is not through programs which, in effect, will say, Turn over all these problems to the Federal Government.  Let us have your money and we'll spend it for you. The way to progress is for the Federal Government to do what it ought to do and what it needs to do, but not to spend a dollar that can be spent better by the people themselves at home right here in Marietta, Ohio."

As I look over a crowd like this, as I realize the inconvenience and the discomfort that was caused to you to have to come here, it makes me know what a tremendous and awesome responsibility it is even to be running for president and even to be thinking of the possibility of being president of this country. I can only tell you that, as see this crowd, I will never forget this day in Marion.  I will remember the people who came here, who stood in the rain and who looked at me, listened to what I have to say, and if you believe, and if your verdict will be, that I am the one to serve you, I want you to know that I will do everything in my power in working for a better America, an America in which we can all move forward together, leaving none behind, an America in which the young people of this country will have greater opportunities than we have even had in our time, and a world in which all men can be free, in which we can live in peace."

Wouldn't it be better, for example, to say--not that we won't be pushed around, but maybe we'll compromise here and there.  Why don't we let Mr. Khrushchev have his part of the world, where the Poles and the Hungarians and the others live, if he will just leave us alone?"

Is my opponent for Mr. Galbraith's plan, or is he going to try to fool the American people in thinking that money comes off of trees? No, he can't get away with this. My friends, you either have to raise taxes or you have to have deficit financing, which means raising prices, or he has to give up part of his programs--and he should tell the American people the truth. What is he going to do--one of these three things? It's time that he told."

I was delighted, too, prior to the time of coming on the stage, to hear you welcome enthusiastically my colleagues who are candidates on my party's ticket in this state.

You know, I have a pretty good deal of experience in seeing candidates, and I've seen a lot of candidates for the Senate around the country, Democrat and Republican. I will say that there is no candidate that I have seen who, from the standpoint of experience, background, and courage, is more qualified to be a U.S. senator from Texas than John Tower.

You know what would have happened? I've been there. I've been there when the President made great decisions. I remember the morning we went into Lebanon. I remember the President pacing the floor of the oval room in the White House. It was a terrible decision for any man to make, even for a man used to great decisions, because the President knew that if he went in it risked war. He knew that if he didn't go in war would probably be sure because the Communists would sweep down through the Middle East. So, finally, he turned to me. He said, We have got to go in. We went in.

The federal government, with its ability to raise funds on a national basis, should aim at reducing the discrepancies among the various states in their resources for the support of education.

But I still don't feel that I am wasting my time by coming out here, and I am very grateful to all of you for being here, and to all of these children. I hope you are not cutting school."
5.18789685245115e-05,0.999948121031476,1033_23,0,"Of course they don't mean to aid and abet our enemies; but the results are the same. Are these the men we want to lead our nation in the struggle against Communism today? All the while they proclaim ferocious anti-Communism. Indeed, the best way they can apparently find to obscure their retreat from the fight against Communism abroad, the fight to keep it distant from our shores, is by shouting and screaming every hour on the hour about how much they hate Communism at home."
4.54350941307666e-05,0.999954564905869,1039_6,0,"I am frank to say we have had very little cooperation from some of the veteran's posts. They are awful keen about this law enforcement, but they continue to use all these devices in their own posts. So it is a little incongruous. They say, By gosh, we are going to clean up crime in this community and get those slot machines out of that corner saloon. But of course, as far as our Legion Post, or VFW, or whatever it is, that belongs to us and it is certainly a different situation. And after all, the device is set to give the fellow at least a sixty to a hundred chance of winning as against one chance in a hundred in the commercial device; and, after all, we own the machine, and it is not owned by a syndicate of operators and placed on a rental basis. And so on and so on."
4.49344625541737e-05,0.999955065537446,1047_1,0,"There is some very important business before our nation, as you all know, and it encourages me to think that these many groups we see all the time have a strong feeling we had better leave the management of our affairs in the hands of the Democratic party. And one reason for this is that it has become harder and harder instead of easier and easier to tell precisely what the Republican party stands for in this campaign. I confess it is early in the morning to be harsh about anybody and to be very critical of anybody. I don't want to be critical or harsh. I have in mind that we are now only a week from our election and we still don't know precisely what the Republicans propose to do about much of anything. We know where they stand on the matter of a new labor relations law, for example. That is precisely where they stood for the past five years. That is an old Republican position."
4.39390214164332e-05,0.999956060978583,1076_4,0,"     We are not only, as I say, a moral country.  This is a brave and a generous country, I think we are bearing our responsibilities well as the strong leader of the free nations against the threat of Soviet communism.  We are doing the hard job that must be done if we are to have a secure place for ourselves and for those children.  We are following out the high ideals of Woodrow Wilson, who wanted to take us our full part--give us our full part--accept our full responsibility for securing the peace back in 1920 after the first World War.  The American people didn't listen to Wilson in those days.  We turned instead to people who led us away from the hard road of international cooperation to the easy  path of isolation.  If we had listened to him we might well have avoided the terrible trial of the second World War, in which 300,000 of our young men died."
4.67698131221849e-05,0.999953230186878,1081_7,0,"     We Democrats are for private and we are for profitable business.  We know America could not survive with any other kind.  We are for the dynamic system of enterprise which has grown out of the great partnership of public and private initiative in this country.  We are against socialism--creeping, crawling, loping, galloping, or even the make-believe kind that takes up so much space in the Republican oratory these days."
4.48873940641255e-05,0.999955112605936,1084_9,0,"I think you know and I know that they have never really been ahead at any time. They just throw so much confetti at each other, read so many of each other's editorials, and cheer each other's speeches so loudly, that they begin to think that everyone agrees with them. Well, they don't. And I think you can rely on the American people every time to tell who is really talking sense and who isn't. "
4.65942146050644e-05,0.999953405785395,1085_15,0,"No, I've seen and heard the deep-throated courage and confidence and faith of strong men and women and happy children--people who still believe in one another, in spite of all the timid, doubting men. And I thank them every one for the reception they have given me--for their infinite courtesy and their heartening friendliness.  I have asked you for your support for my candidacy. I ask you now for support of our common faith in this country. The confidence we've inherited is our greatest wealth, the source of our strength. "
4.87070576622625e-05,0.999951292942337,1092_20,0,"I started my troop duty in the days when we were digging trenches along the Mexican border.  In those days, war traveled no faster than a horse's jog.  I ended my last tour with troops in May of this year.  By then, the pace of war had stepped up to the speed of the jet plane and the impact of the atomic bomb."
4.35748213071264e-05,0.999956425178693,1159_5,0,"Finally, we come down to the source of trouble, the source of all this trouble, and the American people in my opinion are convinced, have reached a basis conviction that most of these troubles were avoidable, that we have been led down a garden path by an administration composed of men who were too little for their jobs, who did not have the intellectual capacity, the courage, the comprehension to come before the American people to admit a mistake and get to work to correct it, but they come before you with some new alibi for pretending the mistake never occurred.  They even call the great war in Korea a police action. Ladies and gentlemen, this all adds up to one simple thing--we have got to have a change and I am not expressing here just my individual opinion.  I am bringing to you what I believe I have seen in the faces and I know I have seen in the telegrams and the notes and the letters and the telephone calls of thousands of Americans.  We can no longer put up with that kind of leadership, a leadership that does not bring us closer to peace in the world and they well know that we can have no peace in the world as long as we have a government that cannot excite your pride.  Until it can excite your pride it is not going to earn the respect abroad that it must have if it is going to lead the world toward peace.  In my mind, that is the basic conclusion of American today.  Not only do we need a change, but we are going to have one."
5.36022643068738e-05,0.999946397735693,1174_32,0,"The program I have outlined demands skilled and purposeful leadership. It demands harmony and understanding between the executive and legislative branches of our government. It will demand an end to what the Senate Preparedness Subcommittee has called abuse, misuse and disuse of power."
4.87621533854718e-05,0.999951237846614,1174_9,0,"Can this burden be lightened without endangering national security? A Democrat administration--stale and self-satisfied from being too long in power complacently says: No, nothing can be done. That is not an American answer. Our answer is: Yes, much can be done."
4.34260410968747e-05,0.999956573958903,1197_12,0,"Then we are accused of wanting to abolish the farm program and the price support.  Well, some things are so false you don't know the right words to use, at least in polite society, for condemning them.  I went to Kasson and on behalf of Republican leaders, and with the concurrence of the great men of the party, at least all that could be reached in time, I stated exactly what we meant to do, and the present 90 percent parity price in the farm program was sustained and supported completely.  Moreover, we pledge that these programs in the future, as it comes time for them to be revised and brought up to date as all programs must be, it will be farmers that will be brought in to Washington whose counsel and advice will not only be sought but, it will be heed."
4.64258937073829e-05,0.999953574106292,1216_17,0,"Now, of course, with the expenditure programs that are required today for necessary purposes, there cannot be any escape for the moment from high costs and high taxes and high prices.  Which makes it all the more necessary that we watch with a jaundiced eye anything that is unnecessary--all of the waste, the duplication, the inefficiency that we know about, and which you would not expect me here today at this time to enumerate.  That must be eliminated and it is the second purpose of this crusade."
4.54820212465534e-05,0.999954517978754,1234_6,0,"This whole-hog theory is that the local citizen--the rancher, the farmer, the municipal government, the state government--don't know anything about their business, and they shouldn't attempt to do anything for themselves but should wait for Washington to tell them how to do it. Now, there are obviously many things that Washington must come in and help if we are going to develop this great West the way it must be developed--and that means to the limit of its capacity to absorb development--but when they do come in, the federal government must come in as a partner; they must take seriously and earnestly the advice and the counsel of the people who are on the spot, and if we don't do that the West will never be developed as it should be. The crusade upon which we are now embarked has that as one of its purposes--in every section, to pay respect, to give due influence to the knowledge and information that local people have on their own problems and not try to do these things from Washington."
4.87686872060276e-05,0.999951231312794,1236_7,0,It is wonderful to visit Houston and see on every hand the signs of your vigorous expansion.  You have fulfilled the vision of those hardy pioneers who set up the early capital of the Texas republic down at the corner of Main Street and Texas Avenue.  You have vindicated their resolute belief in the unlimited future of this region.  Your growth has been phenomenal--the vast industrial development ringing the city; your beautiful churches; your Rice Institute; your University of Houston; your wonderful medical center; and your other institutions of culture and learning.
4.46687613313541e-05,0.999955331238669,1269_10,0,"Last Thursday night, it was my honor to address the dinner annually held in New York in memory of that great American leader, Alfred E. Smith.  I spoke of the undying hate of Communism for our American way of life.  There is no question that we are marked as Communism's final and greatest victim to be."
4.86342809813669e-05,0.999951365719019,1295_12,0,"Those days must not return.  They will not return.  To prevent their return, I pledge to enlist all the resources of private industry and mobilize all the resources of our government to prevent the specter of mass unemployment for once again visiting our land."
4.80203048976799e-05,0.999951979695102,1298_4,0,"Under the guarantee that in this land all men are created equal, your peoples have produced leaders in every field of endeavor--in business and industry, in government, in science and engineering, in medicine and agriculture, in education, in arts and letters.  You have furnished a large share of the manpower and brain power which have made our farms and factories the most productive in the world.  Your people have been in the vanguard of the evolution in this country of an enlightened labor policy.  You have fought to defend America and the principles for which she stands."
4.408878122058e-05,0.999955911218779,1308_18,0,"Ladies and gentlemen, already I have been notified by my associates in front of me that I have used up far more than my time.  I do want to thank each of you who has come out here this morning and given me this time from his busy day not only to bring him a greeting but to allow me to express a few of these thoughts that are on my mind as we go through this political campaign.  I haven't anything in shopworn promises to offer you, but I do tell you this:  When this campaign started and we had some smoothly flowing, high sounding language from the opposition as to what they were going to do--I made a pledge."
4.74216762975648e-05,0.999952578323703,1313_9,0,"Every single member in this crusade is pledged to this idea: That at the first sign of any approaching depression, the full power of private industry, of local and state government, and all resources of federal government will be mobilized to see that never again will we have mass unemployment.  We are committed to the expansion and improvement of social security programs, particularly to saving what is left of our dollars so that your insurance policies, your old age insurance, your unemployment insurance and the rest of itdon't run out of your pocket through that big hole they call inflation.  Unless we stop that, there is no hope."
4.59157246564192e-05,0.999954084275344,1317_1,0,"I want also to express my admiration for the fine ticket for state and Congressional offices which our party has selected here in Massachusetts.  My friend Chris Herter has broad experience and a warm concern for people which fit him to be a great governor of your great state. I stand before you, tonight, in the solemn knowledge that--by this hour of the morrow--you may have summoned me to serve as president of the United States."
4.57096033242669e-05,0.999954290396676,1319_3,0,"No leader in our country has done more, I think, to make state government an instrument for serving the responsible interests of working people--along with all other human interests--than has your great Governor Mennen Williams. Nor has any voice in Washington in these past two years spoken out more plainly and effectively for the rights of labor than that of Senator Pat McNamara. It is a special privilege for me to join you in saluting here today, on its twentieth anniversary, one of democracy's truly great organizations, the United Automobile Workers; and its president, my friend, one of freedom's truest and most effective servants, Walter Reuther."
5.37793933668513e-05,0.999946220606633,1322_8,0,"Yet the administration had opportunities to do something about this pledge. The AFL and CIO presented them with a golden chance to do just this when it called for an international convention against the use of slave labor. Here was a chance to place the United States in a position of active moral leadership, to mobilize the full force of world opinion against the Soviet institution of forced labor, and to establish our sympathy with the cause of these valiant workers behind the Iron Curtain who had risked their lives in the effort to throw off the yoke of servitude."
4.84208275729684e-05,0.999951579172427,1355_11,0,We must work out a program that will mean real security--and dignity and meaningfulness--in the lives of our older citizens. There are great unmet needs for more schools and teachers for our children. There are slums to be closed.
4.52298147482668e-05,0.999954770185252,1366_2,0,"And if you think that's something I tell all the folks, I might tell you that my fondness for this state got me in first-class trouble two weeks ago in Miami, Florida. I was going full speed ahead when I heard myself saying, and you folks here in California know what I mean. They sure did."
4.64537720073723e-05,0.999953546227992,1374_1,0,I suggest to you that both the reputation of the Republican party and the reputation of the Democratic party are undeserved. I would go further. I believe that the Democratic party is the best friend American business has; and I should like to tell you why I think so.
4.73834107366308e-05,0.999952616589264,1379_8,0,"This power has long been the essence of the American ideal. I would hope that all of us would cherish that ideal--that all of us would remember that the perception of truth is more important than which party wins the election. It is only in this spirit that I could ask for your support today--in an unlimited faith in the people, and in an unlimited conviction that the truth will prevail."
4.40140055178785e-05,0.999955985994482,1385_13,0,"Either the President and the Vice President did not know how serious the situation was in the Middle East, or they did not want the American people to know--at least, till after the election. And only last Sunday--just four years ago--Mr. Dulles said in a television interview that the United States, Britain, and France have developed a common policy, and I think it's amazing the degree to which we have had a common policy... and the fact that there are certain minor superficial difficulties as to details about just how you handle tolls, or how much is going to get paid to Egypt and how much isn't, doesn't detract from the fact that we have a common policy. The superficial difficulties of Sunday became pretty formidable by Tuesday, when Britain and France broke with the United States in the U.N."
4.48999808022147e-05,0.999955100019198,1389_21,0,"Oh yes, it has one thing to offer to the American future: It has the vice president of the United States. Every consideration--the President's age, his constitutional position under the Twenty-second amendment--makes it inevitable that the dominant figure in the Republican party under a second Eisenhower term would be Richard Nixon. The emergence of this man raises grave questions."
4.32689790003055e-05,0.999956731021,1391_5,0,"We in the Democratic party think there is nothing we cannot do if we want to do it. The Democratic party believes we have not yet finished making our country, that we still have important work to do. We of the Democratic party think of the people as living human beings, one by one, individuals with differing ways and talents and hopes, each worth in himself the whole weight of government."
4.78148806972055e-05,0.999952185119303,1398_17,0,"Austria. Year after year, since World War II, military division and occupation had plagued the people of Austria. Today, Austria is unoccupied--united--and free."
4.63258558244687e-05,0.999953674144176,1402_46,0,"THE PRESIDENT. Well, they propose to do plenty and are--well, I say are--not plenty, they are doing a lot and they expect to do more. Among other things, you know social security has been extended to many more people in the last couple of years--ten million more. We have gone into special housing programs for the aged. There has been special medical research in the diseases of the aged. There have been special programs started in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare so that the people that are chronically ill, although not acutely ill, could have proper hospital care or proper care within a hospital center. All of that kind of thing is being done and more will be done. But the great thing is, as I see it, to give them finally the income on which they can live in self-respect and dignity, even if they don't live quite as actively as they did when they were younger."
4.85346682600423e-05,0.99995146533174,1405_33,0,He has done an effective job for this state and for all the states of the union. He has served with vigor and forthrightness. He has shown us a great dedication.
4.42813226809067e-05,0.999955718677319,1412_1,0,"We are also deeply grateful that so many Americans have signed their names that they are determined to do their duty this fall in determining the course of America, and are going to get their friends to do the same. I cannot remember any birthday that has been quite so deeply meaningful to me as this one. I thank all of you--Mr. Percy and Miss Dunne particularly for being the chairmen of this great evening."
4.53638316681492e-05,0.999954636168332,1417_22,0,"All of these have meant some worthy effort to promote that understanding, that common reverence of the spirit of justice that will finally bring to the peoples of the earth a peace in which we can confidently trust. But are these wailing politicians really trying to bring Americans to believe that our nation's voice is not urging--daily and powerfully--conciliation, mutual understanding and justice? We are doing exactly that in the Suez problem."
4.53154059308963e-05,0.999954684594069,1436_12,0,"The world has been close to war before--but now man, who has survived all previous threats to his existence, has taken into his mortal hands the power to exterminate the entire species some seven times over. Here at home, the changing face of the future is equally revolutionary. The New Deal and the Fair Deal were bold measures for their generations--but this is a new generation."
4.8842223927917e-05,0.999951157776072,1459_3,0,"Third, we must get on with reclamation and basinwide development across the United States. Fourth, we must appoint a Federal Power Commission that represents the public interest and not the private interest. Therefore, in the 1960s we need a whole new concept of resource development. So vast, so complex, and so essential are our natural resources that they cannot be parceled out piecemeal; nothing less than a comprehensive, basin-by-basin, valley-by-valley development of our natural resources, to make sure that not one drop of our water goes from the wellsprings of our water to the sea without being used for a public purpose."
4.93901590188385e-05,0.999950609840981,1466_12,0,"If the president does not set those standards, if he does not set our national goals, then a senator from Massachusetts, or a senator from California, or the governor of California, or a Congressman, or a newspaper editor, or a system cannot do it. Only the president speaks for the people. Therefore, the president must speak with the people and for the people in setting before them the unfinished agenda. "
4.41813340472081e-05,0.999955818665953,1485_4,0,"How is it possible for us to maintain full employment at a time and in a decade when automation will become a byword? I lived with it for a month in West Virginia. I spent some time in McDowell County, West Virginia, which mines more coal than it ever did in history, more coal than any county in the United States, and has more people getting surplus packages from our government than any county in the United States. What is true of McDowell County and true of the coal industry will be true of other industries stretching across the United States. This is going to be a problem for the next president of the United States. These problems which I now discuss and mention, the problem of an abundant agriculture and an inability to distribute it effectively, all of these problems are so-called domestic problems."
4.514091974161e-05,0.999954859080258,1520_11,0,"Fourth, around the world, when we and the Soviet Union are engaged in a great competition to see whether the world will be free or slave, we continue to persist in regarding the production of food from the ground as a problem, as a surplus, as a burden, when it is a blessing from the Lord. I think we need an administration which so regards it. We spend $42 billion on defense every year. Those ships sail the oceans. They protect us but they do not serve our people and the world. I do not regard the distribution of food around the world as a great burden upon us. I regard it as an opportunity, to use our assets in a way which will attract people to the cause of freedom. I am glad that this is our problem, and not starvation. I am glad we can produce more than we can consume, if we share it usefully, for we are our brother's keeper; and if we have great assets in this country, I believe we should hold out the hand of friendship. When hundreds of millions of people stagger through their lives searching for food and we have it, and we are trying to determine which way the world will go, I would rather see our food used in an imaginative way than to argue in kitchens or anyplace else. I want to help people and I want the United States to be identified with that cause as it was in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and Harry Truman."
4.34136605239791e-05,0.999956586339476,1526_2,0,"The sun is setting and I understand there are no lights--the lights are going out for the Republican party all over the United States. But I want to say one or two things. I spoke this afternoon at the plowing contest on what I consider to be the number one domestic problem which the United States faces, and that is the sharp decline in agricultural income. I think the farmers of North Dakota and the farmers of South Dakota and of Minnesota and Montana have a very clear choice. The question is which party and which candidate can meet their problems in this state, and meet their in this country. They have heard from the Democratic party and they have heard from the Republican party. I remember when President Truman used to say that the farmers had themselves to blame for their difficulties because they voted Republican in 1952. But I don't hold that view wholly, because in 1952, the farmers were informed that the Republican party stood for 100 percent parity not once but at least three times."
4.42626617979988e-05,0.999955737338202,1530_3,0,"On the great domestic issues of resource development, minimum wage, housing, aid to education, Social Security, aid for the aged--all the rest, it has been a history of the Democrats proposing, the Republicans opposing, and then at least in the last eight years fighting for an unsatisfactory compromise. The Senate is Democratic, and we could not mathematically lose control of the Senate. The House of Representatives is Democratic by a wide margin, and I doubt that the Democrats in the House of Representatives will lose control. Therefore, the prospect of four or eight years of a divided government, a government manned by a highly partisan figure, manned by a highly partisan party in the executive branch, and we have seen evidence of it in the last few days--how can we hope, at a time when we need action, how can we hope to possibly move ahead when on the one hand we say yes with the Democrats, and on the other hand we say no with the Republicans? The experience of the month of August in the Congress when both parties were vocally committed to great programs, housing, education, minimum wage, care for the aged--every program fell between the two opposing philosophies of the two parties."
4.66221495151168e-05,0.999953377850485,1550_2,0,"That question is highlighted by one dramatic fact: The head of the Soviet U.N. delegation, Mr. Khrushchev, who is being confined now to Manhattan Island, is the same Mr. Khrushchev who a year ago was invited to Camp David. It is certainly the same Mr. Khrushchev. He represents the same Communist system--still dedicated to achieving world domination. He maintains the same objectives, the same views, and essentially the same tactics."
4.39791186523345e-05,0.999956020881348,1560_0,0,"I understand that Daniel Webster used to address 100,000 people without any trouble at all, and without a mike, so it should be easy for us.  We are a little softer than they used to be. I want to thank you very much for a generous reception.  I am particularly proud that I am associated on the ticket here in Minnesota with your distinguished congressman who has served this district and served the country, Joe Karth, whom I know you are going to send back to the House of Representatives and with your great governor, Orville Freeman, who was generous enough to nominate me at the convention.  But that is not the reason you ought to reelect him.  The reason you ought to reelect him is because he has served this state, and I don't know of a more difficult job in the United States than to be governor of an expanding atate with problems of education, taking care of our older people, the mentally retarded and all the rest.  I think Orville Freeman has moved forward with courage.  I am confident that this State is going to respond to that kind of leadership. "

That is the purpose of this campaign, to build a stronger country here, and in building a strong country, we strengthen the cause of freedom all around the globe. I ask your help in this campaign.  I ask you to join me in a journey across the new frontiers of the 1960s.

We will rebuild our diplomatic corps so we don't send ambassadors and others out because they have contributed to a campaign, who can't even speak the language, who can't even pronounce the names of the heads of the countries, who have never been there, who want to stay there for a year while the communists stay there day after day, speaking the dialect, working subversion, attempting to win control of the country. There are four countries in Africa which are independent, which are members of the United Nations, and there is not an American diplomatic member of our Foreign Service in residence in any of the four.  When Guinea became independent it took us two months to recognize its independence.  It took us eight months to send an ambassador...[missing text]...was there the day they got independence, and Guinea now supports the communist foreign policy."

I just come here in this community, which is mixed, Democrats, Republicans and independents, because two weeks from today, November 8th, Mr. Nixon's and my work will be finished and then you have to decide, you have to make these judgments.  But what is the area of difference between us?  What is the issue on which you should base your decision?  You should not only make a judgment of Mr. Nixon and myself.  You should also make a judgment about yourselves, what you want, about what your view is of your country and your community, about what your view of the future is, whether you are satisfied today or wish to do better.  If you are satisfied, if you feel happy about your life, if you feel our country is meeting its responsibilities, then you belong in Mr. Nixon's camp.  But if you share the view that I hold very vigorously that this country is going to have to do better in the future, that we have responsibilities to meet not only to ourselves but to the cause of freedom, that we are anxious to make sure that in the future people decide that these days were great days in the life of our country, that we must move forward, we must stimulate our growth, we must hold out an image to the world of a vigorous, dynamic society, if we are going to continue to lead the free world--I believe that is the choice.  I don't think if we continue on our present basis that we will be the leader of the free world."

I made my judgment long ago that the basic issue of this campaign was the question of whether the people of the United States believed it was time they started moving again, that they started going forward again, and that the greatest contribution that they could make to the cause of freedom was to build a strong and vital society here in the United States.  Mr. Nixon has chosen a different road.  He has gone to the American people in the 1960s, in the time of change and revolution, saying, We've never had it so good, saying our prestige in the world has never been higher.  I recall in 1935, when Winston Churchill was warning of the dangers of the Nazi rise, Stanley Baldwin, the leader of the Conservative party, told the people of England that everything was being done in its own good time.  He won that election and England almost lost the war."

And to accomplish these things, we will develop to the fullest the untapped natural resources our water, our minerals, our power with which we are so fortunate to be blessed in this rich land of ours. And we shall provide for our scientists, the support they need for the research that will open exciting new highways into the future--new highways in which we shall have progress which we cannot even dream of today.

I think we must emphasize the things that unite America.  I pointed out in speaking to a great labor organization yesterday the fact that Mr. Kennedy had been in Detroit and made the statement that he was for everything union leaders were for, in effect, and that he opposed everything that they were against.  And I said to this group, Look, I'm for many of the things your leaders are for, but I'm not for all the things and I will not make a commitment that I'm for all the things that the leaders of unions or management or farm organizations or any other part or group of America are for, because a president must be president of all America and not just part of America."

I could tell you that the way to get it is just to leave it to Washington, that Washington is going to provide the jobs and the schools and the progress we need, but that isn't the way it work in this country of ours.  The way to progress in America is not through putting the responsibility on the federal government, but for the federal government to adopt policies that will stimulate the incentive and the creative ability of 180 million free Americans, just such as you here."

Second, as far as the future is concerned, I would say that we can look at our experience, I cannot talk about mine.  That is your prerogative to judge that, but I can talk about my running mate's, and I say there's no man in the world today who has had more experience, who has done a better job of representing the cause of peace and freedom than Henry Cabot Lodge, our candidate for Vice President, at the United Nations."

I know the people have spoken to me and they have said, Now Mr. Nixon, you say that you stand for more progress than your opponent does.  You stand for more progress in schools and health and education and welfare.  They say, How can you say this when he says he is going to spend more money for each of these programs than you do?"
4.45998278450656e-05,0.999955400172155,1787_9,0,"Now, talking to that point for a moment, naturally, you have to assume I'm a little prejudiced on that point, but I want to point out that my colleague, Cabot Lodge, and I, begin with a record, and you must hold us accountable for that record.  For seven and a half years we have been part of the Eisenhower administration.  We have sat in the Cabinet, in the Security Council.  We have participated in the discussions leading to the great decisions on Lebanon, Quemoy, and Matsu, and others with which you are familiar."

He had excellent medical care because we're fortunate that the medical care under our system is the best in the world, but his medical bills that year were over $2,000, and I know what a difficult thing it was for him and my mother to pay those bills.  That's why I feel deeply on this subject, deeply from that standpoint and deeply because I think in this country of ours we must find a way in which our older citizens can get the protection that they need when these disastrous diseases come upon them."

Now, the last thing I would say is this campaign has brought out the biggest crowds of any I have ever participated in.  I think it's probably the record.  Crowds from the standpoint of any campaign, including the ones in 1952 and 1956, are enthusiastic.  People believe there is a cause worth fighting for and working for and voting for, and we can win this election.  "

All the criticism in the world of the Eisenhower record in the field of foreign policy isn't going to fool the American people because they know what it is and they like it.  They know that in 1953, when Eisenhower became president, we were in a war.  They know that in these last seven and a half years we got this nation out of one war, we've kept her out of others, and we do have peace without surrender today and they want to continue that kind of leadership."

If you want higher taxes, if you want higher prices, you have a pretty good choice and a pretty good way to get them.  No, I say, we can have progress and that we will have it, but that the way to get it is not through programs which, in effect, will say, Turn over all these problems to the Federal Government.  Let us have your money and we'll spend it for you. The way to progress is for the Federal Government to do what it ought to do and what it needs to do, but not to spend a dollar that can be spent better by the people themselves at home right here in Marietta, Ohio."

4.61665383351805e-05,0.999953833461664,1841_5,0,"Now, some of my friends might say, Well, now, Mr. Nixon, how can you say that?  Isn't that sort of belligerent talk?  Wouldn't it be better, for example, to say--not that we won't be pushed around, but maybe we'll compromise here and there.  Why don't we let Mr. Khrushchev have his part of the world, where the Poles and the Hungarians and the others live, if he will just leave us alone?"
4.56594804347692e-05,0.999954340519565,1848_26,0,"Now, I want to turn from these domestic issues to what is an issue that I have found is even more important.  I suppose some of you may wonder: how can Mr. Nixon possibly say that anything is more important than a good job, security for our old age, medical care and the like?  And, of course, the answer is: being alive is more important."
4.34508128351726e-05,0.999956549187164,1849_3,0,"And also I say this: when all that our opponents offer is a return to the policies, to the kind of leadership, to the kind of a gang we had around the White House in 1952--I say we had enough of it then--we don't want any more of it now.   And, incidentally, that's the same situation here in Illinois.  You know what boss rule means with the Cook County gang up there.  You don't want any part of it.  That's why you're going to re-elect Bill Stratton down here, and we're going to re-elect him with a majority that all of the people of this state will be proud of. "

He now says he agrees with the President on Quemoy, that he didn't really mean the President should have apologized, and that as far as Cuba was concerned, he always meant all the time he was really for what the President was, and that is standing morally for the right of people to be free. But, my friends, just let me say this one last thing: when you're a candidate, you can make a mistake and you can correct it the next day. When you're president and you make a mistake, it's for keeps."

I do not suggest to you that if I am elected I will not make mistakes. I do only say, however, that I know what these problems are. I do say that, having been through the fire of decision, as I described it, I do believe that in these years ahead I can avoid some of the mistakes that might come from rashness, from shooting from the hip, from impulsiveness."

They make the promises, but we produce on the promises that they make--and that's what we want.  Now, a third point that I want to make has to do with the development of this great state. You know, the easy thing to do is to come to a state like this and say to you: the federal government is going to take over all of your problems. The federal government is going to promise you this, that, and the other thing. As a matter of fact, it's rather interesting that when we look at this campaign, it's had a rather amusing twist in a sense because, as you notice, the slogan that our opposition is using: Kennedy is the remedy. Well, you know, that's like the old medicine man who used to come to town--the same remedy for everything--spend more money--and that's your money. Now, the difference was, you know, that the medicine man had the same remedy--different labels on the bottle--it would cure snakebite or rheumatism or anything else, but it really didn't do it; and the difference was the medicine man always got out of town just before the people caught up with the fact that the remedy didn't work. The trouble in the case of Mr. Kennedy--he didn't get out of town soon enough, and the people are going to find it out on November 8th."

Kennedy who stood before you eight years ago and said these words to you:  I would like it to be said that in our administration, our country moved, but special emphasis on education, took care of our children and gave medical care to the aged and that we ended discrimination of all kinds in the United States.

This does not necessarily mean there will be war. It does mean that the diplomacy requirements of the United States must be infinitely greater if we are to avoid it.

Let us at least draw some meaning that is lasting from their martyrdom. As I said here in Los Angeles last night to a large rally in the streets--I have no careful solutions to offer, and nothing that is strikingly new to say. What needs to be said once more all around the world is Let us stop the killing and stop the killing everywhere. Let us stop it here in our own land before we convince our own children that violence is in fact the normal way of life. Let us stop it while we still have the capacity to love one another as human beings--not just the few people right in our neighborhood, our own families and those around us--but people everywhere who, like us, want their years of happiness and life. But if I have anything to say about the course of events in the years ahead, there is one thing, above all else, that I would like to say and do. I would like to make it possible for a child in the Middle East, or anywhere else around this world, to live a full and secure and happy life before that child dies. I want to try to make it possible for that little girl in Vietnam that we saw running into the arms of the camera lens on fire from Napalm to be blessed by the warmth of love rather than the tragedy of war. I want to try and make it possible for people to live as though we really were created in the image of God rather than in the image of our worst fears and suspicions of each other. So I say Peace--not just now, but peace always. I say Peace--not just in one land, but in every land where there are men and women and children who don't know what it is to see a sunrise or to see trees in the springtime. I see and say Peace--on a planet which gives us life, among people who have no right to take it away from others. And I ask, as I did last night, that you say with me, in the words of that great prayer of St. Francis of Assisi, Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. And then we will reap all of the blessings that we, and the generations before us, had hoped for, and our children will bless us because we have given them the fullness of life.

But while there is anxiety here at home, we have to understand that the nations of Europe would switch places with us in a minute. We have lower inflation. We have lower interest rates.

For it is a very solemn hour indeed, freighted with the hopes and fears of millions of mankind who see in us, the Democratic Party, sober understanding of the breadth and depth of the revolutionary currents in the world. Here and abroad they see in us awareness that there is no turning back, that, as Justice Holmes said, We must sail sometimes with the wind, sometimes against it; but we must sail and not drift or lie at anchor. They see in us, the Democratic Party that has steered this country through a storm of spears for twenty years, an understanding of a world in the torment of transition from an age that has died to an age struggling to be born. They see in us relentless determination to stand fast against the barbarian at the gate, to cultivate allies with a decent respect for the opinion of others, to patiently explore every misty path to peace and security, which is the only certainty of lower taxes and a better life."

It gives large scale application to the principle that flood control must begin at the top of the hill where the first trickle of water starts. It is the most important and hopeful attempt thus far made to reduce the crest of floods by holding back more water on the uplands where it falls and by retarding runoff of the remainder. From Virginia to California, from Iowa to Texas, I have seen evidence of America's need for flood control and soil conservation. This is one of the battles that must go forward if we are to build in the United States the fair and fruitful land of our dreams."

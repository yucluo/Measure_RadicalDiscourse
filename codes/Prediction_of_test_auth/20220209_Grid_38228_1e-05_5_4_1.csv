5.16330535946843e-05,0.999948366946405,1023_2,0,"My heart is very much in these programs because whenever you travel through this great land of ours, you can't help but see how much these programs have meant to so many people. Above all, our Democratic platform calls for action on the overshadowing problems of war and peace--the most important unfinished business of our generation--and I mean steady resistance to Communism and patient and persistent efforts to build a peace which has been man's dearest goal from time immemorial. Now, in these few words--if these were all that you knew about me and about our Democratic platform, well, I will have to confess that you wouldn't know very much for it is easy to get up here on a campaign train and say some nice sounding words, but out of our party you get a lot more than some high sounding words--you get first of all the record of twenty years of solid accomplishment, of accomplishment in the interests of all our people, and I hope you will compare this record with the Republican record before you vote--for, by the way, they have a record too during these past twenty years, and it is easy to sum up that record. Whenever there has been a forward looking, a constructive program to oppose, they have opposed it, and that is about all their record amounts to."
5.3664816085855e-05,0.999946335183914,1023_6,0,"And I wish that these men of little faith could see America, as I have seen it; could talk to the countless thousands that I have had the privilege of meeting with, like you here this afternoon, all across our broad rich land during these past two months. America is a great, a strong, a wise, and most of all a good country. And I believe with all my heart that by these qualities, we can and we will safely in God's good time win our way to a peaceful world."
5.22196903695558e-05,0.99994778030963,1054_5,0,"I think, regardless of political considerations, that it is essential that if we are going to win in the long term this conflict with Communists--this conflict with a society that seeks to spread itself over the entire globe--that we must recognize that until we find the means--and until we find cooperation in the means of restoring a sense of well-being to peoples who know little of freedom in the terms that we understand it, that we will have a very threatening and a hostile enemy. That is why one can believe that the importance of bolstering our defenses by the foreign aid programs--Point Four, and things of that kind--are essential if we are going to hope to frustrate the designs of this godless tyranny throughout the world. I thank you so much for affording me this opportunity of participating even briefly in the ceremonies. I count you very fortunate indeed to have this splendid housing development in your neighborhood; and I can add that I am very jealous of it. I should like to be participating in a similar project in Chicago where we too have desperate need of the advantages of public housing."
6.0613069352723e-05,0.999939386930647,1067_14,0,"We must do nothing that might array class against class, or citizen against citizen, in quarrels which tear apart our blessed American family. I shall do all I can to sustain a feeling of mutual confidence and understanding among all segments of our society. I see the American people rejoicing in their strength and sure of their destiny--and I see them from coast to coast--and for such a brotherhood among our people, I think everything is possible. "
5.53723972745256e-05,0.999944627602725,1069_9,0,"We also have my sister Mrs. Ernest Ives. And now I should like to present to you a famous Pennsylvanian, a beloved and honored lady of this state, Mrs. Emma Guffey Miller. Have we got any more beauties to present?"
5.26083335598414e-05,0.99994739166644,1076_4,0,"     We are not only, as I say, a moral country.  This is a brave and a generous country, I think we are bearing our responsibilities well as the strong leader of the free nations against the threat of Soviet communism.  We are doing the hard job that must be done if we are to have a secure place for ourselves and for those children.  We are following out the high ideals of Woodrow Wilson, who wanted to take us our full part--give us our full part--accept our full responsibility for securing the peace back in 1920 after the first World War.  The American people didn't listen to Wilson in those days.  We turned instead to people who led us away from the hard road of international cooperation to the easy  path of isolation.  If we had listened to him we might well have avoided the terrible trial of the second World War, in which 300,000 of our young men died."
5.27382798849658e-05,0.999947261720115,1101_15,0,"We are in that war because this administration allowed America, in a time when strength was needed, to become weak.  Consequently it felt compelled to take its forces out of that region. We are in that war because, having helped set up the Korean Republic, and knowing that strength was being massed against that republic north of its borders, there was a failure to build up adequate strength in Korea's own defense forces."
6.34820718531751e-05,0.999936517928147,1127_31,0,"I will not support any amendments which weaken the rights of working men and women.  In seeking desirable amendments, I will ask the advice and suggestions of all groups--public, management, and labor.  And, gentlemen, I assure you that this invitation of mine will be genuine and in good faith.  It will not be one of those empty theatrical gestures so often made in recent years.  In my own mind I have complete confidence that this job of amending the law can be worked out so that no fair-minded member of your group will consider the results unreasonable.  No such legislation must ever be regarded as final, and in considering amendments to labor legislation, labor will have an equal voice.  It is the American way to take what we have and constantly seek to make it better."
5.37741368837761e-05,0.999946225863116,1137_6,0,"Much of my life in the service of my country I have been forced to spend abroad.  It does one thing for you, ladies and gentlemen.  It makes certain that every time you come back you think more of this country.  If there is any veteran in this whole crowd who didn't have that same feeling when he came stemming into New York or San Francisco or Seattle or Norfolk, then I would be astonished because I have never yet met one who has not said, Well, one good thing a tour abroad does for you; it makes you understand how well worthwhile it is working here at home."
5.2113653780253e-05,0.99994788634622,1179_4,0,"That record is a distinguished one.  It should be remembered that the negative votes on the North Atlantic Treaty, the Vandenberg Resolution and the Marshall Plan included negative votes of the party in power.  That is a tribute not just to a man but to a party.  Senator Vandenberg, if he were living, would be the first one to resent the suggestion that the votes to which I refer represented a personal triumph.  Rather, they represented to him the dedication of a party which, although it was an opposition party, subordinated partisan considerations to the national welfare."
5.47202534330832e-05,0.999945279746567,1207_5,0,"First, the government you have must be one to excite your pride, to get you to unite behind it.  There can be no peace in this world until there is a strong America leading us toward peace--strong spiritually, economically, financially, and finally militarily. We are going to have that kind of strength only if we are united behind a government that excites our pride.  Such a government will have great prestige abroad; the free countries will want to join with us in establishing a collective security."
5.79582775760377e-05,0.999942041722424,1220_40,0,"In this enterprise which I describe, we are not trying to remake the world in the image of America.  We are not trying to force any man to our way if it is not his.  We are not trying to buy peace or bring peace with the sword."
5.56801479296674e-05,0.99994431985207,1222_3,0,"If on top of that we have the military force we need then we are strong.  But how will we do all those things?  We will do them ladies and gentlemen only if we are a united people, united behind the great aspirations and purposes of our government.  And right there is the crux of the matter.  You must have a government that you trust, respect and believe in, if you are going to have a united United States.  A united United States would be a strong bulwark of peace.  A united strong United States can lead the free nations of the world into that kind of collective security program that will lift a great burden from our hearts:  the burden of fear abroad."
5.38108404262432e-05,0.999946189159574,1249_17,0,"There is a cruel duplicity involved on the part of an administration which has pledged social security for some, and then through waste and careless financial policies, has caused an inflationary insecurity for all. And now we come to another glaring example of our national leadership's failure to live up to high ideals.  I refer to the McCarran Immigration Law, which was passed over the president's veto at the last session of Congress.  A new immigration law was certainly needed.  But with leadership, rather than vetoes, we should have had, and we must get, a better law than this McCarran Act."
7.62722674402893e-05,0.99992372773256,1269_10,0,"Last Thursday night, it was my honor to address the dinner annually held in New York in memory of that great American leader, Alfred E. Smith.  I spoke of the undying hate of Communism for our American way of life.  There is no question that we are marked as Communism's final and greatest victim to be."
5.51183331097658e-05,0.99994488166689,1270_16,0,"Then, we must get our own administrative house in order to handle better our part of the task of economic cooperation.  Today, the White House, the State Department, the International Trade Section of the Department of Commerce, the Treasury Department, the Mutual Security Administration, the Point IV planners, the Pentagon, and the international business enterprises go their several, uncoordinated, though well-meaning ways.  Without impinging upon the rights and responsibilities of private enterprise, including private investors, we must coordinate and mobilize mutually-beneficial economic cooperation, as effectively as we mobilize for military defense."
5.11158983968063e-05,0.999948884101603,1280_3,0,"We have got to get dedicated men and women from all over this United States who have been living closer to the people, who have not grown arrogant by being too long in power, who have not gotten too complacent or indifferent or think they can sell any bill of goods of fear and despair to America and so secure its votes. Now, if we are going to have a fresh start on this thing, we have got to have a complete change in the political complexion in Washington.  I picked up this morning a little clipping.  I am going to read to you just two sentences:  In South Bend, Indiana, yesterday, someone from the crowd addressed by the Democratic candidate, the administration's hand-picked candidate, shouted this question, Would you fire Acheson?   And it says here, Dean Acheson, the Secretary of State, and the answer was this, I will answer questions like that after the election, the Governor replied.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is the only answer the poor man could make.  He has the record, this sorry record of the last seven years to defend, and here is one he can't defend; but he can't on the other hand, say in advance, I repudiate that record and the people who have made it.  But I say, this crusade in which I am engaged does repudiate that record of error, and we are ready to replace from top to bottom.  No one has anything but admiration for the great body of public servants of America who are contained in the civil service and in the uniformed services.  We are talking, in this top to bottom clean-out, about these political appointees, the policy-makers, if you please, of our country--and not only in domestic policy but in this foreign field."
6.94211421102013e-05,0.99993057885789,1307_8,0,"I am very proud also that I had wonderful friends who jumped into the breach to defend me against this charge.  I didn't have to do it myself.  Rabbi Silver and Bernie Baruch and Cardinal Spellman took care of that one, and Judge Reynolds and a few others took care of it.  I more than ever pledged myself to see that we remove the remaining stains of discrimination from our national life.  We can do that if it isn't made a partisan issue, but we must have the aid of men from both parties--if they are men of good will and that is what I intend to do--and what I say I will do I will do."
5.41625965559889e-05,0.999945837403444,1327_2,0,"Well, the American people won't be fooled. What matters is not what it says on the label, but what is inside the package. And inside the Republican package is the same old stuff, the same Old Guard, the same old promises they make every four years. They still shine--but then, why shouldn't they? They've never been used."
5.57400744380723e-05,0.999944259925562,1342_3,0,"Yet only a few weeks later he made his unhappy peace with the party. That was when he said, on October 30, 1953, that he favored the election of every Republican over every Democrat for every office any place. And that is the course he has pursued ever since. He has not hesitated to endorse any Republican, be he a Taft Republican or a McCarthy Republican. The only notable exception was an Eisenhower Republican--Senator Wiley of Wisconsin, for whom the President didn't lift a finger. It used to be said that Mr. Eisenhower would reshape the Republican party. You cannot help but wonder today who has reshaped whom."
5.12164859309613e-05,0.999948783514069,1343_6,0,"Four years ago, the voters could reasonably believe that Mr. Eisenhower's personal crusade would alter traditional Republican policies and, indeed, remake the Republican party in his own image. Today, the record makes it clear that this has not been done--and circumstances make it certain that it will not be done in the four years ahead. It was not, as some sought to suggest, the habit of the past that sustained your faith in the Democratic party in 1952. It was rather your vision of the future. It is true that Southerners have long memories, and many bitter things to remember. But it is also true that the South is caught up today in a rushing pattern of change that makes this in many ways the most exciting and the most promising region in our country."
5.78555662708303e-05,0.999942144433729,1357_16,0,"The most obvious weakness, of course, is the ease with which our national forests, our wildlife refuges, our parks and streams, and public lands have been invaded and turned to selfish private purpose. But more important even than that, perhaps, is the shunting aside of men who are experienced and trained in a lifetime of conservation work, in favor of politician appointees. The agency that looked at tomorrow's needs for minerals has been disbanded--and nothing put in its place. The Soil Conservation Service has been weakened--and must be revived. We need the leadership that will look at the nation's needs for water, for areas of recreation in the great open country, for land, and forest, and streams. We need, in other words really to look together at the needs and resources of our common future."
5.16310594709187e-05,0.999948368940529,1364_8,0,"Does the President really object to his administration being called indifferent to unemployment? I remind him that his Secretary of Defense talked about workers out of jobs as kennel or hunting dogs, and that it was a White House assistant who said of unemployment this spring that the right to suffer is one of the joys of a free economy. And I want to say something, too, about another kind of indifference. I mean about the crisis in education in this country. The President said last night that twice in his State of the Union messages--in 1955 and 1956--he urged swift action--and that he even called a conference on education."
5.33060739948387e-05,0.999946693926005,1381_15,0,"Yet the Republicans sneer and call it nonsense and a theatrical gesture, even though we are now learning that the administration itself had been giving serious consideration to this same or a similar proposal. When I have suggested stronger, more efficient armed forces than the inefficient, expensive, and undemocratic draft system provides, they scream in unison that I'm trying to weaken our armed forces. Yet leaders of our defense services have been saying the same thing for months. And the Democrats in Congress have even forced the Eisenhower Administration to do more for our defenses than it wanted to."
8.22378824709883e-05,0.999917762117529,1388_7,0,"We badly need to get down to fundamentals. The first is that whatever the provocation, aggression can no longer be tolerated in the atomic age. This has been our position always. We welcome the U.N. resolution as expressing the sense of the world community on this point, and we all hope that a cease-fire can be promptly arranged."
5.33923835407266e-05,0.99994660761646,1397_5,0,"With all of the facts of our economy, with all of the facts of the world scene, you can go before the American public. And again I say: Tell the truth, tell it forcefully. And that should be our campaign."
5.39030558868467e-05,0.999946096944113,1401_11,0,"That line of thinking suggests that old story of Abe Lincoln's about a fence and a pig. The fence was so crooked that every time the pig went through it, he came out the same side he went in. Lately, it seems some people have gone the pig one better. On price supports, they've come out on both sides of the fence."
5.57794495522419e-05,0.999944220550448,1417_24,0,"Yet in our labor toward the peace we seek, we must comprehend always its basic requirements and face up to them manfully. First: strength--spiritual, intellectual, economic and military strength. Second: unity--our clear awareness that the road to peace is one that all nations must travel together, else none can do so. Third: faith--a faith in the greatness of our purpose that inspires in all of us a readiness to work and to sacrifice that this greatest of all mankind's hopes may one day be realized."
5.71783771646488e-05,0.999942821622835,1424_5,0,"Now, permit me two observations. First, I offer a simple suggestion to any leader of the opposition. I suggest that, if I were anxious to win the confidence of the American people and remembering the Washington mess of only four years ago--there is one word that is the last that I would take from out the whole dictionary to use in a political argument--and that word is corruption. When this word is uttered in any political hall of the opposition, it echoes with a most curious ring. I know why, for I recall an old but grim proverb. It comes from the greatest Spanish novel ever written. And it warns: Never mention rope--in the house of one who has been hanged."
0.000206672483431377,0.999793327516569,1426_12,0,"Eventually, as in the satellites today, the cost proves greater to a once proud and independent people than the value of the monuments or the factories or the prisons that have been erected. In those lands, the fruits of imperialism are discontent, unrest, riots in one place and demonstrations in another, until the tyranny exercised over them either dissolves or is expelled. The day of liberation may be postponed where armed forces for a time make protest suicidal. But all history testifies that the memory of freedom is not erased by the fear of guns, and the love of freedom is more enduring than the power of tyrants. But it is necessary that the inspiration of freedom, and the benefits enjoyed by those who possess it, are known to those oppressed."
5.65404317335748e-05,0.999943459568267,1466_12,0,"If the president does not set those standards, if he does not set our national goals, then a senator from Massachusetts, or a senator from California, or the governor of California, or a Congressman, or a newspaper editor, or a system cannot do it. Only the president speaks for the people. Therefore, the president must speak with the people and for the people in setting before them the unfinished agenda. "
5.27222390203432e-05,0.999947277760979,1477_4,0,"I was impressed by what Sam Rayburn said. I don't think there is any man in this century who has written more significant legislation of benefit to the people than Speaker Rayburn. He does it. He secures the support of the members of the House of Representatives from all states of the Union. He secures the undeviating loyalty of the majority leader from Massachusetts, John McCormack, his strong right arm, because they know that he speaks not only for Bonham, Texas; he speaks for the United States. And Lyndon Johnson, unanimously chosen on three different occasions by every senator of the United States in the Democratic Party to be the majority leader, was chosen because he was not only a senator from Texas, but a senator of the United States."
5.24198125234919e-05,0.999947580187476,1497_1,0,"Many of us are government employees. I have a different office in Washington than you who work here in the city of Trenton, but I think that all of us who work for the government in one service or another, or all of us who work in other capacities, have a great and common interest in this campaign, and that is the advancement of the interest of the United States--to increase its power and prestige; to make it more secure; to make it possible in a dangerous world, when hazard surrounds us on every side, to make it possible for us to move safely ahead in a world of peace, protecting not only the security of the United States, but holding out the hand of friendship to all those who wish to be associated with us. Other Democratic presidents in this country--Woodrow Wilson, who served in this city, in this state, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman--all faced difficult and dangerous times. The election of 1932, I think, meant the preservation of freedom here in the United States. But I think the election of 1960 may well mean the preservation of freedom all around the globe."
5.33883613103613e-05,0.999946611638689,1546_2,0,"I think this state and this country have been made by people who were not satisfied. Mr. Nixon has said that I am downgrading the United States. I am not at all. I could not possibly feel stronger about this country and about what it can do. But I think the Republicans have put limitations on what we can do. We want to upgrade the leadership. We want to make this country in a position of unmatched security, both at home and abroad."
5.23809106775324e-05,0.999947619089322,1559_15,0,"As one indication of how serious is the debate now taking place, last week, Monday night in the debate, I said that our power superiority is threatened by growing Soviet hydropower, a growth which is so rapid that it threatens to overtake the United States by 1975.  Mr. Nixon said later this week that that statement was false.  He boasts of tremendous power development during the past eight years, and he asserted that the Russians can overtake us only if we did nothing for fifteen years, while they built eight Grand Coulee Dams a year.  That is his charge and what are the facts?  The facts were reported last year by a committee of the U.S. Senate, over which Mr. Nixon occasionally presides.  That committee's findings, and I quote, were Although the United States is still far ahead, the Russians could overtake us in 1975, in fifteen years, unless we speed up or they slow down.  Both countries will have, the Senate said, an equal power generating capacity which will be 337,500,000 kilowatts in 1975."
5.16886738801001e-05,0.99994831132612,1582_4,0,"When the United States is second in space, when we turn out one half as many scientists and engineers, the Soviet Union, when their economic growth is three times our now, and Western Germany, Italy, and France twice the growth, when we have to find 25,000 new jobs a week for the next ten years to maintain full employment in Indiana and the country, I cannot believe that the people of this state and the people of the United States are going to give an endorsement and continue that leadership. I ask you to join us in moving ahead.  I ask you to put your confidence in our party and in our leadership, a leadership which in this century has produced Mr. Truman and Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Wilson.  I do not ask you to put your confidence in a leadership in this century which has produced Mr. McKinley and Coolidge and Harding and Hoover and Landon and Dewey and now in 1960, Mr. Nixon.  I believe we can do better."
5.48575608708363e-05,0.999945142439129,1588_10,0,"Only a third of the homes in the island even had running water, and in the years which preceded the Castro revolution this abysmal standard of living was driven still lower as population expansion outdistanced economic growth. Only ninety miles away stood the United States--their good neighbor--the richest nation on earth--its radios and newspapers and movies spreading the story of America's material wealth and surplus crops. But instead of holding out a helping hand of friendship to the desperate people of Cuba, nearly all our aid was in the form of weapons assistance--assistance which merely strengthened the Batista dictatorship--assistance which completely failed to advance the economic welfare of the Cuban people--assistance which enabled Castro and the Communists to encourage the growing belief that America was indifferent to Cuban aspirations for a decent life."
5.4232757754567e-05,0.999945767242246,1624_11,0,"We have to do better than this if this great bureaucracy of ours, if this great government of ours, is going to function in the sixties.  We have to prepare it for motion, we have to prepare it to move, we have to get the best people we can get, and then we have to organize our structure so that they can act.  And that is not the situation today.  "
5.63778870434423e-05,0.999943622112956,1628_6,0,"Now, this decline is continuing, and the program that Mr. Nixon has put forward in my opinion will provide for a further decline in farm income, because he provides the same program that Mr. Benson provides, which is a support price for corn or wheat, soybeans, whatever it may be, which is tied to 90 percent of the average market price for the three previous years.  Now, as the market price drops so drops the support price.  Where you had $1.50 for corn eight years ago, you may be getting 90 cents for corn today, or 93 cents.  That is the market price.  Mr. Nixon will pay you 90 percent of that market price next year, and if it drops to 85 cents, he will pay you 90 percent of that, and that is the step, down, down, down, until farmers are driven off their farms in increasing numbers."
5.4900631678555e-05,0.999945099368322,1641_0,0,"My friend Bob Wagner, guest of honor Pat Clancy, Reverend Clergy, Bert Kohl, Frank O'Connor ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Bob Wagner.  He and I are graduates of the Al Smith school of dinners of last night.  The Vice President claimed Al Smith for his work in his latter years and I claimed him for his work in the 1928 campaign.  Neither one of us indicated what Al Smith would do in 1960.  It is possible he would have voted Republican but I think he would have prayed Democratic this year."
5.9265824571019e-05,0.999940734175429,1643_11,0,"I believe that we can get at this matter very fairly.  There are now within the department of state certain studies and certain polls which have been made of our position overseas.  The state department has been reluctant and unwilling to release them, even though they have been paid for by the taxpayers of the United States, and even though the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Fulbright, has asked that they be made public, for our information.  Mr. Nixon said that he had no objection, and I will quote him: He would have no objection to making them public.  I challenge him to demonstrate his influence with this administration and his willingness to have the real facts known.  "
5.13228750385856e-05,0.999948677124961,1725_1,0,"This campaign is coming to an end Tuesday night.  Then you have to decide.  You have to make your judgment.  I made my judgment long ago that the basic issue of this campaign was the question of whether the people of the United States believed it was time they started moving again, that they started going forward again, and that the greatest contribution that they could make to the cause of freedom was to build a strong and vital society here in the United States.  Mr. Nixon has chosen a different road.  He has gone to the American people in the 1960s, in the time of change and revolution, saying, We've never had it so good, saying our prestige in the world has never been higher.  I recall in 1935, when Winston Churchill was warning of the dangers of the Nazi rise, Stanley Baldwin, the leader of the Conservative party, told the people of England that everything was being done in its own good time.  He won that election and England almost lost the war."
7.49243509504465e-05,0.99992507564905,1751_17,0,"So looking to the future these are the things that I believe America can and must do if we are to have peace and have it on the basis that I suggested is essential. First, of course, and we will all agree with this, America must have military strength which is not only second to none, but strength which, combined with our allies, is sufficient, that regardless of what a potential enemy may have, that if he should launch a surprise attack against us anyplace in the world we will have enough left to destroy his warmaking capability. Why do I set that particular standard?  Not because we ever want to use that strength, because if we have that strength it means that is the greatest single guarantee that a potential enemy of peace will not use his strength against us."
5.40801474099569e-05,0.99994591985259,1757_10,0,"I think it's one of the primary responsibilities of a presidential candidate and, certainly, an overriding responsibility of a president himself to emphasize these great ideals that join us together, to unite Americans rather than to divide them sectionally into occupations and the like, and that's why I refuse to go before one group and make them promises that will set them against another.  I think we must emphasize the things that unite America.  I pointed out in speaking to a great labor organization yesterday the fact that Mr. Kennedy had been in Detroit and made the statement that he was for everything union leaders were for, in effect, and that he opposed everything that they were against.  And I said to this group, Look, I'm for many of the things your leaders are for, but I'm not for all the things and I will not make a commitment that I'm for all the things that the leaders of unions or management or farm organizations or any other part or group of America are for, because a president must be president of all America and not just part of America."

So, first, because he is a man who understands power and respects it, because he is a man who will use power if he can get away with it, to accomplish his ends, we must make sure that he never believes he is strong enough and that we are weak enough that he could start something without risking national suicide on his own part. And, so, the first necessity of leadership in these critical years ahead is that the United States must continue to be what she is today--the strongest nation in the world.  And, my friends, we must continue to maintain that advantage that we presently have, and the next president must be prepared to ask the American people for whatever was necessary to maintain it because through that strength in our hands, we serve the cause of peace.  We serve it because we will never use it in aggression.  We will only use it to deter those who would threaten the peace or threaten the freedom of others."

Second, as far as the future is concerned, I would say that we can look at our experience, I cannot talk about mine.  That is your prerogative to judge that, but I can talk about my running mate's, and I say there's no man in the world today who has had more experience, who has done a better job of representing the cause of peace and freedom than Henry Cabot Lodge, our candidate for Vice President, at the United Nations."

This great struggle in which we are engaged is not just one of strength of our arms or the productivity of our factories.  That is all it is to the Communists.  That is all it is they have to offer.  But let Americans never forget that we stand for something more than that.  Let Americans never forget that when we were a small nation and a weak nation 170 years ago, that we still were a strong nation in the minds of the world, because our ideals were strong.  What are they?  What do we stand for?  We stand for faith in God.  We stand for belief in dignity of every man, woman and child regardless of his background.  We stand for the right of all men to be free, not just Americans.  We stand for the right of each nation to be independent, not just the American nation."

Now, it would be presumptuous for me to say anything about who ought to be the next president.  It would be presumptuous for me to say anything about myself.  I have often thought this about my running mate.  I certainly think he's got it all over his opponent, but I can say something in regard to Pat, and this has nothing to do with regard to her opponent, because the ladies are not running against each other.  I will say this, whatever people may think of me, Pat would make a wonderful first lady."

But again, we don't stand on it.  How do I say that we can do this job?  Well, first, when you look at my colleague and I, we know Mr. Khrushchev.  We have sat down across the conference table with him.  We know that he is a man who is ruthless and tough.  We know that you must never make him a concession unless you get a concession in return.  That's why President Eisenhower was right in not doing what Mr. Khrushchev asked him to do again in the paper this morning, in not apologizing and not expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev as Senator Kennedy suggested he might.  That is why the next president of the United States must recognize that Mr. Khrushchev does not react like Mr. Nehru, he isn't like Mr. Adenauer, or Mr. Macmillan.  He is a man determined to conquer the world and so, first, we will keep America strong--the strongest in the world.  Second, we will see that the economy of this country moves forward so that Mr. Khrushchev never will be able to get through on his boast that he is going to catch us.  Third, we will see that we are firm, but we will never be belligerent, because we realize that while we hold the line for principle, we must always negotiate for peace, but never, again, making concessions, as I say, which don't get concessions in return."

He sets forth before the United Nations a program that will work, one that will make certain that when one party disarms, the other does likewise, and unless we have that kind of agreement, America can never reduce its strength--and I know all of you agree with that. And, so, I say to you tonight: I stand here speaking of this record.  I stand here talking of experience but most of all, I stand here to tell you that my colleague and I, knowing the men with whom we deal, know that we can never rest for a moment on our record, that we must move forward militarily.  We must move forward economically.  We must always keep the initiative in the diplomatic arena, and we will."

He had excellent medical care because we're fortunate that the medical care under our system is the best in the world, but his medical bills that year were over $2,000, and I know what a difficult thing it was for him and my mother to pay those bills.  That's why I feel deeply on this subject, deeply from that standpoint and deeply because I think in this country of ours we must find a way in which our older citizens can get the protection that they need when these disastrous diseases come upon them."
5.302453926387e-05,0.999946975460736,1799_13,0,"So let's be sure, as we go into this stretch, we step up our campaign, that we step it up and also that we don't do it just with the hip hip hooray of a meeting, but that we recognize it's going to be won right down there, won or lost in the battleground.  They know  it.  They're going to pour in, without any question, hundreds of thousands of paid workers, in many instances.  I say hundreds of thousands.  That may be an exaggeration.  There certainly will be thousands of paid workers in some of the key industrial states.  They will be poured into this campaign.  We've got to combat them with volunteers, because that's all we have, but a good volunteer worker can always beat a paid worker, if he works, and so I say let's outwork them and outfight them in these last three weeks, and we'll win Arizona and the nation.

Such efforts toward personal security, first, are right--not only from the humanitarian viewpoint, which all of us will understand--they are mandatory if our complex modern society is to work at its best, at its fullest.  They are essential to our purpose.  And what is that purpose?  I think, summed up in a sentence, it is this: we must lift the ceiling over personal opportunity.  We must strengthen the floor over the pit of personal disaster.  Public policy, therefore, should seek to put right what is wrong in our America, but it should also seek to strengthen what is right.  It should recognize the plain fact that Americans are proud and self-reliant individuals.  Programs that encourage individuals to depend on government are wrong, for increasing dependence by a people upon government is not a sign of strength; it is a sign of weakness, and in this day of competition with the Communists, Americans must be sturdy and strong."

Let us at least draw some meaning that is lasting from their martyrdom. As I said here in Los Angeles last night to a large rally in the streets--I have no careful solutions to offer, and nothing that is strikingly new to say. What needs to be said once more all around the world is Let us stop the killing and stop the killing everywhere. Let us stop it here in our own land before we convince our own children that violence is in fact the normal way of life. Let us stop it while we still have the capacity to love one another as human beings--not just the few people right in our neighborhood, our own families and those around us--but people everywhere who, like us, want their years of happiness and life. But if I have anything to say about the course of events in the years ahead, there is one thing, above all else, that I would like to say and do. I would like to make it possible for a child in the Middle East, or anywhere else around this world, to live a full and secure and happy life before that child dies. I want to try to make it possible for that little girl in Vietnam that we saw running into the arms of the camera lens on fire from Napalm to be blessed by the warmth of love rather than the tragedy of war. I want to try and make it possible for people to live as though we really were created in the image of God rather than in the image of our worst fears and suspicions of each other. So I say Peace--not just now, but peace always. I say Peace--not just in one land, but in every land where there are men and women and children who don't know what it is to see a sunrise or to see trees in the springtime. I see and say Peace--on a planet which gives us life, among people who have no right to take it away from others. And I ask, as I did last night, that you say with me, in the words of that great prayer of St. Francis of Assisi, Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. And then we will reap all of the blessings that we, and the generations before us, had hoped for, and our children will bless us because we have given them the fullness of life.

Now we need a powerful military force but we also need to remember that the great foundation of this nation is based on the health of our people and the quality of our lives and the unity of our homes and our neighborhoods and our communities.

I'm not going to help him. Let him shift for himself. So Hubert Humphrey never went to serve in the Oval Office; Richard Nixon did.

Even more important for the overall health of the economy, it means two percent on those loans that business people need to take out to start those new businesses or to expand the businesses.

And we will get it done. Good, sensible, reasonable, responsible government, giving more power back to the states, back to the governors, back to Governor Steve here starting next year--back to the governors, back to the legislatures."

I use me too in the grammatical, not the political sense. Which reminds me that there was a big meeting out here yesterday--a sort of bipartisan gathering with representatives from both branches of the Republican party. I don't know how the peace conference got along but they had a good time criticizing us for everything, as usual. They even accused me of the crime of visiting President Truman the other day--a crime that hasn't been committed since Rutherford B. Hayes, because the party in power has not nominated a candidate who was neither a member of Congress nor the Cabinet in seventy-five years. I thought I detected an explanation of their difficulty in finding something to say, however, when the orator of the day, Senator Nixon, revealed that out at the camp in Colorado, General Eisenhower's vacation headquarters, they ate fried mush most of the time.

As a result, we of this generation, who saw farm conditions at their worst in 1932, have had the happy privilege of seeing them over the last decade at their best. I am proud of the work my party has done in these twenty years to restore the American farmer to a position of equality and dignity in our national life. "

And it is against Democrats, so far as I can see, not after a sober and considered review of the alternatives, but automatically, as dogs are against cats. As soon as a newspaper--I speak of the great majority, not of the enlightened ten percent--sees a Democratic candidate it is filled with an unconquerable yen to chase him up an alley. "
5.38538597958778e-05,0.999946146140204,916_30,0,"It would seem to me, my friends, that the Republican critics could better demonstrate the good faith of their concern for Asia by doing something about India and Pakistan today rather than talking about China yesterday. I don't think the tearful and interminable post-mortems about China will save any souls for democracy in the rest of Asia, the Near East, and in Africa. India is not caught up in civil strife. It can be helped in a way that is natural to us and best for it; help in the ways of peace and of social progress. India has to grow more food. It has to restore its land. It needs new resources of power. In short, it needs a democratic helping hand in the development programs it has already charted for itself."

Your extraordinary yields of long-staple cotton, melons, grapes, alfalfa, and all the other crops contribute to the well-being of all of us in the whole country. We in Illinois are better off because you in Arizona are better off. In fact, nothing is so thoroughly shared as productivity and increased prosperity."
5.21936276343775e-05,0.999947806372365,934_3,0,"In Illinois, we cleaned up, we disinfected, we fumigated a state government that had been the victim of eight years of magnificent rascality--and I mean Republican rascality. Now, actually it doesn't make any difference whether it is Republican or Democratic rascality; a bad public servant is a bad apple and you throw out a bad apple whatever its variety. That is what I believe and I think that is what we are going to do at every level of our government, if the people are conscious enough of what their responsibility is. But rascals in government are only the uglier practices of wasters in government. Economy is just as important as honesty--for a taxpayer's dollar that is wasted is just as bad as a taxpayer's dollar that is stolen. And here again I lay what I hope is not an immodest claim to some hard and educational experience in making both ends of a government budget meet, in keeping a government lean and trimmed down to an efficient size. I have some idea about that; as the product of practical experience in Illinois, I have learned that economy in government isn't just something that you say you are going to have. You have to grind at it all of the time. You have to grind--everybody--up and down the ladder; the purchasing officers who spend millions of the taxpayers' money, the fellows who deal around in government orders, even the girls who want to use a fresh carbon every time they want to write a letter. It is the same old business day and night. You've got to live it yourself twenty-four hours a day."

Our programs grow from what we think are people's needs--and I don't mean just a few people--I mean all of the people. And that means equality of opportunity for all, regardless of race and color or creed. Most of all today we stand for peace--not for another war to end all wars, but for peace without war. We are not making the promises that the Republicans are, and we don't play politics with promises we know we cannot keep. We are trying to talk straight to the American people. We are recognizing that the course ahead of us is a stern course; that there are no easy, cheap solutions for Communism, for want, for hunger, for all of the miseries that torment our world. But we believe with all of our hearts that if we make this nation strong we can keep good times at home and avoid that war that would destroy the world. "

Today America is more prosperous than any other nation in history. Of course, the Old Guard orators are going around the country these days broadcasting gloomy warnings that our prosperity is a fake, that it is based on war, that a depression will come with peace. This is nonsense. The truth is that our tremendous defense effort is holding us back, gobbling up the goods our people need at home, and when we have at last won through to safer waters, we shall be able to work at a hundred and one tasks that need doing.

We must continue to meet the present urgent needs of the people. Too many Americans today dwell in misery in tenements in our huge congested cities--second-class citizens living in third class houses. Too many Americans still live in rags in sharecroppers' shacks. Too many Americans find that rising living costs are outrunning their pensions, social security benefits, life insurance proceeds and their salaries. The cost of living and wages have been chasing each other up and up in a dizzy, dangerous spiral of inflation that spells disaster for everyone. And we know what to do about that too, if the Republicans will just keep their hands off."

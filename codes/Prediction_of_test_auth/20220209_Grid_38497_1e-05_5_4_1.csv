But I still don't feel that I am wasting my time by coming out here, and I am very grateful to all of you for being here, and to all of these children. I hope you are not cutting school."
6.27001529311621e-05,0.999937299847069,1018_2,0,"This is a very happy experience for me and I am deeply touched and grateful to all of you for coming here and making my arrival in Albany so agreeable. I want to say to you that one of the happiest experiences that I have had in my brief life as a politician has been today in New York state. Not the least of it has been the fact that I have been privileged to travel with one of the most beloved and respected citizens of our generation, your Senator Herbert Lehman of New York."

Are these the men we want to lead our nation in the struggle against Communism today? All the while they proclaim ferocious anti-Communism. Indeed, the best way they can apparently find to obscure their retreat from the fight against Communism abroad, the fight to keep it distant from our shores, is by shouting and screaming every hour on the hour about how much they hate Communism at home."
7.03748642597046e-05,0.99992962513574,1039_6,0,"I am frank to say we have had very little cooperation from some of the veteran's posts. They are awful keen about this law enforcement, but they continue to use all these devices in their own posts. So it is a little incongruous. They say, By gosh, we are going to clean up crime in this community and get those slot machines out of that corner saloon. But of course, as far as our Legion Post, or VFW, or whatever it is, that belongs to us and it is certainly a different situation. And after all, the device is set to give the fellow at least a sixty to a hundred chance of winning as against one chance in a hundred in the commercial device; and, after all, we own the machine, and it is not owned by a syndicate of operators and placed on a rental basis. And so on and so on."
7.03004451127177e-05,0.999929699554888,1043_11,0,"There has been loose talk of a war of liberation to free the enslaved peoples of Eastern Europe. Such a war is unthinkable and would destroy the very people and the civilization that we seek to save. Yet the day of liberation will come, and there is much we can do in the meantime to help the unhappy people of Eastern Europe. Through the United Nations much is being done to rally the conscience of mankind. We can offer help and encouragement to those thousands of families and those individuals who are escaping, month by month, through the chinks in the Iron Curtain."
6.53948495028673e-05,0.999934605150497,1091_22,0,"There is a whole lot you and I can do about this on Election Day, November 4th. We can make sure that the whole atmosphere of our government is one of common honesty. With honesty, we will have competence. We will set an example of industry and integrity which will again make free government the shining object of admiration and respect throughout the world."
6.55048537241403e-05,0.999934495146276,1095_6,0,"The next thing we must do is remember this:  There are many group tasks that must be done by us in our families, in our communities, in our states, and finally in the nation.  Lately it seems to be too much in the nation.  We do these things together because no one can do them for himself alone.  We must approach those group problems with a spirit of cooperation, a readiness to accept the responsibilities of each of us which are group in character.  If we do not do that then there comes that creeping tide of central law that finally results in the all-powerful state, and we do it because we are regimented.  Let us do our jobs at home, first in the family, then in the village, then in the state.  Let's not let the central government get any more of them than we have to."
6.24983224579122e-05,0.999937501677542,1101_15,0,"We are in that war because this administration allowed America, in a time when strength was needed, to become weak.  Consequently it felt compelled to take its forces out of that region. We are in that war because, having helped set up the Korean Republic, and knowing that strength was being massed against that republic north of its borders, there was a failure to build up adequate strength in Korea's own defense forces."
6.38515430237181e-05,0.999936148456976,1103_1,0,"My three days have carried me into quite a few corners of our country, so you may be interested in a few observations that I think are accurate. My first two days were spent in six southern cities. I was interested to see what were the subjects that seemed to interest them most, subjects involving national problems and the national scene, and then to compare those with similar reactions in the north. In my opinion they are identical."
6.34582851208188e-05,0.999936541714879,1137_6,0,"Much of my life in the service of my country I have been forced to spend abroad.  It does one thing for you, ladies and gentlemen.  It makes certain that every time you come back you think more of this country.  If there is any veteran in this whole crowd who didn't have that same feeling when he came stemming into New York or San Francisco or Seattle or Norfolk, then I would be astonished because I have never yet met one who has not said, Well, one good thing a tour abroad does for you; it makes you understand how well worthwhile it is working here at home."
6.45349158528334e-05,0.999935465084148,1150_1,0,"I had a wonderful story told me about your town, that only last August in the midst of carrying on your fair you had a great storm that destroyed the buildings and tents and it looked like it was going to be disaster and no fair.  You people pitched in on your own.  You didn't even wait for a Washington bureaucrat to come down and do it.  You did it yourselves.  Moreover, I am told what you could expect in that little incident, that the elephant stayed on the job working until the last and the donkey played out--just too old, too tired."
6.38030019562075e-05,0.999936196998044,1158_2,0,"I get up early in the morning and I talk all day long.  By evening my vocal chords are showing the strain and my disposition and everything else.  But then I think of you people who work not only on an intensive basis like that part of the time, but all the time, keeping the party together, keeping it financed, keeping it presented properly before all the people, and I realize what public service really means.  It is not just the limelight, although sometimes these lights are pretty bright, at that.  It is the day by day chore."
6.84949734853228e-05,0.999931505026515,1187_0,0,"Good afternoon, folks.  You know, folks, it strikes me that Senator Dirksen must indeed be a very powerful Senator when he can arrange by remote control such weather for this meeting.  I pay my compliments to him.  To each of you I extend my very warm thanks for coming here this afternoon, for giving me a chance to greet you, to say hello, and to express to you one or two thoughts that I have in mind as we progress in this political campaign."
7.26217275835005e-05,0.999927378272417,1193_16,0,"At a critical moment in World War II, we induced the Nazis to hold an entire army in reserve in the Calais area to meet an attack that they thought was coming but which we never intended to launch.  Measures to deceive them worked so effectively that they estimated our original strength in Europe at seventy-five divisions instead of the actual thirty-six. In the entire American record in Europe there is no single instance where the enemy gained essential information of our plans through the medium of spies or subversive agents."
6.30006667216695e-05,0.999936999333279,1207_1,0,"You know, this thing seems to me to be particularly significant:  this evening there will be 6,000 more Americans than there were last evening.  Those Americans, of course, are largely our new babies born.  When each baby is born today it gets a very extraordinary present as it arrives into this world:  it gets its share of the national debt; it owes $1,750 for the privilege of having been born."
7.13850373810355e-05,0.999928614962618,1216_15,0,"Now, let us talk for just a moment about these goals that all of us who are in this crusade are supporting.  Now, I do not mean just the purpose of supplanting a worn-out administration in Washington.  That is merely the first step.  This crusade of cleaning out an inept and bungling administration will take as its first job that of cleaning out corruption."
6.59721355073167e-05,0.999934027864492,1220_4,0,"Just north of where we are gathered tonight passes a historic line that encircles the globe.  This line is invisible in America, but in another land it is traced in blood.  It is the 38th parallel, the line which divides North and South Korea."
6.9200713902093e-05,0.999930799286098,1220_40,0,"In this enterprise which I describe, we are not trying to remake the world in the image of America.  We are not trying to force any man to our way if it is not his.  We are not trying to buy peace or bring peace with the sword."
6.73656747158631e-05,0.999932634325284,1234_6,0,"This whole-hog theory is that the local citizen--the rancher, the farmer, the municipal government, the state government--don't know anything about their business, and they shouldn't attempt to do anything for themselves but should wait for Washington to tell them how to do it. Now, there are obviously many things that Washington must come in and help if we are going to develop this great West the way it must be developed--and that means to the limit of its capacity to absorb development--but when they do come in, the federal government must come in as a partner; they must take seriously and earnestly the advice and the counsel of the people who are on the spot, and if we don't do that the West will never be developed as it should be. The crusade upon which we are now embarked has that as one of its purposes--in every section, to pay respect, to give due influence to the knowledge and information that local people have on their own problems and not try to do these things from Washington."
6.3198845740651e-05,0.999936801154259,1266_7,0,"But finally and more important than that, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few weeks I have gone up and down the length of this land.  I have promised farmers that when they have problems, bring those problems to Washington.  If the United States chooses to place on me and my associates in this crusade the responsibility for conducting the national governmental affairs during the next four years, each of these problems will be solved only after complete consultation with the people affected.  I have made that promise and that pledge to farmers.  I have pledged that to labor.  On Labor Day I said, The pledge that this crusade makes you is this:  We would be firm, we would be just, we would be fair, but we will be friendly.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is what I should say that a new administration could do instantly on this problem.  Not only could they bring in advice, general advisors and consultants on the whole problem of promotion of small industries throughout our country, but they could bring in specifically, from this area people of management and business and investment and labor, the men who are working and out of work, bring them in and say, Let us find out what we can do here, what can the federal government do legitimately without interfering with your lives, but in a friendly, helpful sort of way that will both to the benefit of the federal government and to this city."
7.07602544353702e-05,0.999929239745565,1269_21,0,"A strong America, a well-governed America, an America that is morally and spiritually sound, is the best answer to the evil threat of cynicism and lack of self-respect within, and to the evil threat of Communism without.  If you believe that as I do, will you join our crusade? This crusade which I have taken to the American people represents what I, myself, believe.  I have acted and I have spoken from my own deep inner convictions of what is best and right for America.  I have been steadfast to my convictions.  I have made no deals.  I am still a no deal man.  And let me tell you just this:  I have lived sixty-two years and one week and I have never been anyone's captive yet.  And never will be!"
6.75732339226713e-05,0.999932426766077,1285_32,0,"It is up to you, the voters of America, to see that their rule is broken. Like Belshazzar, they have had their feast.  And like Belshazzar, they have begun to see the handwriting on the wall."
6.64540295766754e-05,0.999933545970424,1290_14,0,"Now, ladies and gentlemen, in concluding this short statement, I want to say this:  I do not come before you to engage in any competition of political promises.  This party in power in the last seven years has used up every possible political promise there is, and some of them have gotten pretty shopworn.  For example, there is no easier way to duck an issue than to say this, I will promise you a law, well knowing they cannot deliver it.  There is no easier way to get out of a situation.  What I promise you is work, never ending work, to make certain that justice is done.  So I cannot come before you with the competition of promises, but I do come before you with a pledge, and this is the pledge.  If you want to put this crusade at the helm of your government; if you want to substitute for these 22 caliber men who are trying to hold 45 caliber jobs the finest men and women that we can draw from all sections of this country, from every walk of life--and let me say plainly, based upon merit and without respect to color or creed; if you want to have a government of that kind, then you belong in this crusade."
6.42267166635091e-05,0.999935773283337,1293_2,0,"I am exceedingly proud, my friends, to address you in a hall that is a war memorial, dedicated to our veterans. I hear that more than twenty-thousand people contributed their funds to make this hall possible.  Whenever anything comes to my attention that involves veterans, I, like most other old soldiers, want to reminisce a bit.  Never do I get tired of reminiscing about the heroism, the sacrifices, the devotion to our country of the millions of men and women who made up our fighting forces in World War II.  I am really proud that the city of Johnstown has chosen to take a building such as this that will be used by your citizenry through the years to make it a lasting useful memorial to their services."
7.21910130691989e-05,0.999927808986931,1303_4,0,"The essential difference between this worn-out bureaucracy in Washington and the crusade is this:  They want to sit in Washington and direct your lives and your businesses and check up on you from thousands or hundreds of miles away.  We want to see you develop yourselves with every single thing you have got in you and hold the government ready to help you whenever it is necessary, but to work with you and not just to work you. We believe that if we bring to Washington the outstanding men and women of this crusade--your representatives, people coming right out of this crowd, men who have been introduced to you from this platform--that all of those people will be your guarantee that there is no crookedness in government, that subversion and Communism isn't getting inside of government.  They will be your guarantee that if a stray individual does go bad and betrays his trust, that kind of thing will be ripped out of government without delay."
6.38352266721288e-05,0.999936164773328,1318_14,0,"Don't misunderstand me. I, for one, am ready to acknowledge the sincerity of the Republican President's desire for peace and happiness for all. But good intentions are not good enough and the country is stalled on dead center--stalled in the middle of the road--while the world goes whirling by. America, which has lifted man to his highest economic state, which has saved freedom in war and peace, which saved collective security, no longer sparks and flames and gives off new ideas and initiatives. Our lights are dimmed. We chat complacently of this and that while, in Carlyle's phrase, Death and eternity sit glaring. And I could add that opportunity, neglected opportunity, sits glaring too!"
7.25332076932059e-05,0.999927466792307,1322_4,0,"I want to pay tribute, on the Labor Day, to the magnificent role that American labor, under the leadership of the AFL-CIO, has played in the world wide struggle with Communism. No agency, public or private, has been more effective in arousing the hearts and minds of the plain people of the Free World to an awareness of the menace. By its leadership in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, American labor has welded the free trade unions of every nation into a solid front against Communism."
6.29550237296901e-05,0.999937044976271,1335_23,0,"The Republican congressman from this very district, Mr. Hyde, said of the classroom problem, There is not a state in this Union which cannot afford to take care of that need. Another Republican congressman suggested that classes were too small and that they should go into the evening and run twelve months of the year. And, though President Eisenhower was nominally in favor of aid to education, this particular congressman on April 12, 1956, read into the Record a letter from the President in which Mr. Eisenhower said, I would flatly oppose any grant by the federal government to all states in the Union for educational purposes. I am perplexed to say the least, but contradiction--unilateral as well as multilateral--seems to be about the only entertainment these Republicans have contrived."
6.60544754544738e-05,0.999933945524545,1342_3,0,"Yet only a few weeks later he made his unhappy peace with the party. That was when he said, on October 30, 1953, that he favored the election of every Republican over every Democrat for every office any place. And that is the course he has pursued ever since. He has not hesitated to endorse any Republican, be he a Taft Republican or a McCarthy Republican. The only notable exception was an Eisenhower Republican--Senator Wiley of Wisconsin, for whom the President didn't lift a finger. It used to be said that Mr. Eisenhower would reshape the Republican party. You cannot help but wonder today who has reshaped whom."
6.17696214231407e-05,0.999938230378577,1364_8,0,"Does the President really object to his administration being called indifferent to unemployment? I remind him that his Secretary of Defense talked about workers out of jobs as kennel or hunting dogs, and that it was a White House assistant who said of unemployment this spring that the right to suffer is one of the joys of a free economy. And I want to say something, too, about another kind of indifference. I mean about the crisis in education in this country. The President said last night that twice in his State of the Union messages--in 1955 and 1956--he urged swift action--and that he even called a conference on education."
6.28912090726481e-05,0.999937108790927,1367_9,0,"And, you know, he said that Eisenhower had had another new idea--to wage peace not war. When he said that I blinked and thought again of Woodrow Wilson and the last-ditch Republican fight against the League of Nations. I thought of Franklin Roosevelt and the United Nations. I thought of the Truman Doctrine, and aid to Greece and Turkey. I thought of the Marshall Plan, Point 4, and NATO and the great Democratic struggle of a generation for peace, in which I am proud to have played a very small part myself. "
6.46337344763058e-05,0.999935366265523,1374_20,0,"The fact is that the Republicans, taking over the country at a high point of economic activity, have done nothing for such vital groups in the population as small businessmen and farmers--and have done less than nothing to prepare for the difficult problems of the future. The Eisenhower administration seems to have confused genuine friendship for business with snuggling intimacy toward a few of its giants. And meanwhile the big have gotten bigger and the small are disappearing."
6.26913940477383e-05,0.999937308605952,1377_5,0,"At Peoria, four years later, the President told his Republican audience that what he meant at Kasson, was that farmers should get their parity in the marketplace. If that means anything, it means they should get parity without price supports. And if that is what Mr. Eisenhower meant, why didn't he say so four years ago? He didn't say so because he knew that any such statement would have cost him."
6.37564737261356e-05,0.999936243526274,1385_13,0,"Either the President and the Vice President did not know how serious the situation was in the Middle East, or they did not want the American people to know--at least, till after the election. And only last Sunday--just four years ago--Mr. Dulles said in a television interview that the United States, Britain, and France have developed a common policy, and I think it's amazing the degree to which we have had a common policy... and the fact that there are certain minor superficial difficulties as to details about just how you handle tolls, or how much is going to get paid to Egypt and how much isn't, doesn't detract from the fact that we have a common policy. The superficial difficulties of Sunday became pretty formidable by Tuesday, when Britain and France broke with the United States in the U.N."
7.47107760949078e-05,0.999925289223905,1388_7,0,"We badly need to get down to fundamentals. The first is that whatever the provocation, aggression can no longer be tolerated in the atomic age. This has been our position always. We welcome the U.N. resolution as expressing the sense of the world community on this point, and we all hope that a cease-fire can be promptly arranged."
6.63460060440809e-05,0.999933653993956,1389_20,0,"The Republican party has no program to offer America, no policy, no philosophy. In fact, it seems to have little else but President Eisenhower--who in the next years would inevitably recede more and more from the picture. The fact is that the Republican administration has taken everything from the Democratic past--and offers nothing to the American future."
6.45607991667153e-05,0.999935439200834,1391_5,0,"We in the Democratic party think there is nothing we cannot do if we want to do it. The Democratic party believes we have not yet finished making our country, that we still have important work to do. We of the Democratic party think of the people as living human beings, one by one, individuals with differing ways and talents and hopes, each worth in himself the whole weight of government."
6.8497880172306e-05,0.999931502119828,1401_35,0,"Where there was doubt, there is confidence. My friends, I believe that these facts plainly mark the path of our nation's progress. If you also believe this--if you want to keep on this way--then each of you must do your part to the full in making your decision clear and emphatic."
6.81319899517863e-05,0.999931868010048,1417_22,0,"All of these have meant some worthy effort to promote that understanding, that common reverence of the spirit of justice that will finally bring to the peoples of the earth a peace in which we can confidently trust. But are these wailing politicians really trying to bring Americans to believe that our nation's voice is not urging--daily and powerfully--conciliation, mutual understanding and justice? We are doing exactly that in the Suez problem."
6.31685686732824e-05,0.999936831431326,1425_5,0,"Now, in the work for peace, again, each of us has a job to do--to make certain that our nation stays strong, that we live in the faith of our fathers, that peace can finally be achieved for the world, that we can do our part in right thinking, in working at our daily jobs to convince others in the world that we want none of their property, we don't want to dominate them, we merely want the opportunity for all men who love freedom to have it, to hold it, and to enjoy it. This is our task, not only for those who are in the Congress and in the state gubernatorial chairs and in the legislatures. All of us--America--must stand together, stand strong and be of one mind if we are, from our position of strength, going to lead really on the road of peace."
0.000385435145005441,0.999614564854994,1426_12,0,"Eventually, as in the satellites today, the cost proves greater to a once proud and independent people than the value of the monuments or the factories or the prisons that have been erected. In those lands, the fruits of imperialism are discontent, unrest, riots in one place and demonstrations in another, until the tyranny exercised over them either dissolves or is expelled. The day of liberation may be postponed where armed forces for a time make protest suicidal. But all history testifies that the memory of freedom is not erased by the fear of guns, and the love of freedom is more enduring than the power of tyrants. But it is necessary that the inspiration of freedom, and the benefits enjoyed by those who possess it, are known to those oppressed."
6.65023994644808e-05,0.999933497600536,1428_4,0,"And so for the political pessimists who think Americans can accomplish nothing unless government bureaucracy does it for them, I have a prescription. This is it:Go to Miami. Just spend a few hours there. See what the people of that area have done on their own, for themselves and for the good of our whole country."
6.42516798434207e-05,0.999935748320156,1477_4,0,"I was impressed by what Sam Rayburn said. I don't think there is any man in this century who has written more significant legislation of benefit to the people than Speaker Rayburn. He does it. He secures the support of the members of the House of Representatives from all states of the Union. He secures the undeviating loyalty of the majority leader from Massachusetts, John McCormack, his strong right arm, because they know that he speaks not only for Bonham, Texas; he speaks for the United States. And Lyndon Johnson, unanimously chosen on three different occasions by every senator of the United States in the Democratic Party to be the majority leader, was chosen because he was not only a senator from Texas, but a senator of the United States."
6.27175248481422e-05,0.999937282475152,1497_1,0,"Many of us are government employees. I have a different office in Washington than you who work here in the city of Trenton, but I think that all of us who work for the government in one service or another, or all of us who work in other capacities, have a great and common interest in this campaign, and that is the advancement of the interest of the United States--to increase its power and prestige; to make it more secure; to make it possible in a dangerous world, when hazard surrounds us on every side, to make it possible for us to move safely ahead in a world of peace, protecting not only the security of the United States, but holding out the hand of friendship to all those who wish to be associated with us. Other Democratic presidents in this country--Woodrow Wilson, who served in this city, in this state, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman--all faced difficult and dangerous times. The election of 1932, I think, meant the preservation of freedom here in the United States. But I think the election of 1960 may well mean the preservation of freedom all around the globe."
6.57583623399145e-05,0.99993424163766,1546_2,0,"I think this state and this country have been made by people who were not satisfied. Mr. Nixon has said that I am downgrading the United States. I am not at all. I could not possibly feel stronger about this country and about what it can do. But I think the Republicans have put limitations on what we can do. We want to upgrade the leadership. We want to make this country in a position of unmatched security, both at home and abroad."

Only ninety miles away stood the United States--their good neighbor--the richest nation on earth--its radios and newspapers and movies spreading the story of America's material wealth and surplus crops. But instead of holding out a helping hand of friendship to the desperate people of Cuba, nearly all our aid was in the form of weapons assistance--assistance which merely strengthened the Batista dictatorship--assistance which completely failed to advance the economic welfare of the Cuban people--assistance which enabled Castro and the Communists to encourage the growing belief that America was indifferent to Cuban aspirations for a decent life."

So I address myself to that problem and I feel very strongly about it.  I think I disagreed with Mr. Nixon on it.  He states that he is satisfied with what we are now doing.  He referred to the term growthmanship, somewhat disparagingly.  I think it is a very important matter, because it goes to the future of our position around the world.  Now the question is what can we do to stimulate our growth."

Now, as the market price drops so drops the support price.  Where you had $1.50 for corn eight years ago, you may be getting 90 cents for corn today, or 93 cents.  That is the market price.  Mr. Nixon will pay you 90 percent of that market price next year, and if it drops to 85 cents, he will pay you 90 percent of that, and that is the step, down, down, down, until farmers are driven off their farms in increasing numbers."

There are 15 million American homes, according to the last Bureau of the Census, which are substandard.  Mr. Nixon has issued a paper on housing, and this, I think, is most revealing of all and one of the most endearing qualities of the Vice President.  In his position paper issued in New York within the last three weeks, he says that the Housing Act of 1949 has worked very well, and do you know as a congressman he voted against it?  In that position paper he called for greater emphasis on middle-income housing and he voted against that in 1950.  He calls for a greater flow of housing credit so that the American people can buy houses at low rates of interest.  But he neglects to mention his vote as vice president to increase the interest rates on the GI housing bans.  High interest rates never built a single home and one of the reasons why we are building 200,000 less homes each year than we should to keep up with our population increase is because of the high interest rate policy of this administration.

Now, this morning the papers reveal, and I have the New York Times in my hand, that the Information Service of our state department has been conducting polls throughout ten countries of the world to try to find out their view of the United States.  These polls have been confidential, but the papers evidently got hold of them.  Here is what the headline says, and it really goes to the whole issue of this campaign: The U.S. Survey Finds That Others Consider the Soviet the Mightiest.

I just come here in this community, which is mixed, Democrats, Republicans and independents, because two weeks from today, November 8th, Mr. Nixon's and my work will be finished and then you have to decide, you have to make these judgments.  But what is the area of difference between us?  What is the issue on which you should base your decision?  You should not only make a judgment of Mr. Nixon and myself.  You should also make a judgment about yourselves, what you want, about what your view is of your country and your community, about what your view of the future is, whether you are satisfied today or wish to do better.  If you are satisfied, if you feel happy about your life, if you feel our country is meeting its responsibilities, then you belong in Mr. Nixon's camp.  But if you share the view that I hold very vigorously that this country is going to have to do better in the future, that we have responsibilities to meet not only to ourselves but to the cause of freedom, that we are anxious to make sure that in the future people decide that these days were great days in the life of our country, that we must move forward, we must stimulate our growth, we must hold out an image to the world of a vigorous, dynamic society, if we are going to continue to lead the free world--I believe that is the choice.

Do you know that we brought more foreign students to the United States ten years ago than we do today?  Last year, Guinea asked for 500 teachers.  Do you know how many we sent them?  One.  Do you know there are more students studying here from Thailand than from Africa south of the Sahara?

Do you know that we are fourth in the world behind Radio Cairo in our radio broadcasts from the United States?  Do you know that the Soviet Union spends ten times as much as we do in Spanish broadcasts to Latin America?  This administration is experienced?  I don't think any judge would give a man who had forty accidents a new driver's license.  I don't think an administration which has presided over three recessions in the last eight years, which is now presiding over the lessening of the U.S. position around the world, which has permitted the U.S. image to fade as a vital society, our most important asset, which has in that way damaged the cause of freedom, I cannot believe that any young man or woman who looks to the future can possibly decide to sit down and sit still and look back with Mr. Nixon and the Republican party which has always opposed progress."

First of all, let's recognize a fundamental fact. You hear a lot of talk about the farm problem these days, and from a political standpoint it's a difficult one. But let's never forget that there is no greater asset that we have in our struggle with the forces of slavery than the tremendous incredible productivity of America's farmers. Mr. Khrushchev knows this. He told me when he got back to Washington that he was pretty impressed with what he saw on the farms in Iowa that he visited, and he has reason to know it and I'll tell you why: because here in the United States approximately 6.5 million farmers and farmworkers produce as much as 50 million farmers and farmworkers produce in the Soviet Union. That, you see, gives us a tremendous advantage which we must retain. But since we owe this to our farmers, we must see that our farmers get what they do not receive today, and that is a fair share of America's increasing prosperity, and this can be done. The problem is difficult. As I've indicated, I'm going to touch upon it in detail in Iowa on Friday and a speech in South Dakota at the national plowing contest the next night."

Now, it would be presumptuous for me to say anything about who ought to be the next president.  It would be presumptuous for me to say anything about myself.  I have often thought this about my running mate.  I certainly think he's got it all over his opponent, but I can say something in regard to Pat, and this has nothing to do with regard to her opponent, because the ladies are not running against each other.

We say that history tells the American people that the way to progress is not through weakening individual responsibility but strengthening it.  We say that history tells the American people that the way to progress is not to weaken the states and their responsibility, but to strengthen them.

You stand for more progress in schools and health and education and welfare.  They say, How can you say this when he says he is going to spend more money for each of these programs than you do?"

But again, we don't stand on it.  How do I say that we can do this job?  Well, first, when you look at my colleague and I, we know Mr. Khrushchev.  We have sat down across the conference table with him.  We know that he is a man who is ruthless and tough.  We know that you must never make him a concession unless you get a concession in return.  That's why President Eisenhower was right in not doing what Mr. Khrushchev asked him to do again in the paper this morning, in not apologizing and not expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev as Senator Kennedy suggested he might.  That is why the next president of the United States must recognize that Mr. Khrushchev does not react like Mr. Nehru, he isn't like Mr. Adenauer, or Mr. Macmillan.  He is a man determined to conquer the world and so, first, we will keep America strong--the strongest in the world.  Second, we will see that the economy of this country moves forward so that Mr. Khrushchev never will be able to get through on his boast that he is going to catch us.  Third, we will see that we are firm, but we will never be belligerent, because we realize that while we hold the line for principle, we must always negotiate for peace, but never, again, making concessions, as I say, which don't get concessions in return."

Yes, yes, we march, we marched for Franklin Roosevelt out of the dark days of the Depression when he said that all we had to fear was fear itself and we marched right on through that Depression and America went on to win a great victory not only over a Depression, but in World War II and we marched with Harry Truman, who told it just like it was and he did something about it, too, for all of us, and we marched and we marched with John F. Kennedy who stood before you eight years ago and said these words to you:  I would like it to be said that in our administration, our country moved, but special emphasis on education, took care of our children and gave medical care to the aged and that we ended discrimination of all kinds in the United States.

That's why we are proud to be Democrats.

The average teacher in America today starts at about $14,000 or $13,000 a year.  In some states it's far less.  I was in Florida a year ago, and I saw a teacher's schedule that showed a teacher who had twenty years of teaching with a doctorate degree made $17,000 a year.  I may be off a couple thousand, but I remember being shocked by the figure.  I have talked to any number of young people who went into teaching full of hope and found out they just couldn't stick with it, couldn't afford it.  I talked to a young man in New Hampshire.  I don't think he voted for me based on the returns, but we had a nice conversation.  He told me that, more than anything, he wanted to be a science teacher.  But he had a family of two kids, he was now thirty-six years of age.  He said, I couldn't do it.  I had to get out.  And I made double or triple whatever it was in the private sector.  What is happening today is that a lot of young, skilled people are not going into education.  The tests show that a disproportionate number are testing at the lowest levels of skills and aptitudes.  That doesn't mean a lot of them won't become good teachers.  We ought to have a society in which both in terms of the environment of teaching being honored as a profession and the pay, is such that the very best, the top of each class, goes into education.  I think last year--as I recall, in Los Angeles--I believe I was told that a beginning teacher there made $13,000 and a beginning policeman $28,000.  I don't begrudge the policeman's salary at all.  But we're saying something about teaching when we give it this low status, and, of course, our kids will pay and our nation will pay.  By now we should know that it is the product of the trained mind that is the greatest source of wealth in America.  It's more important than all of our national resources, everything.  That's from an economic standpoint.  But education, of course--that's why I use the word learning--goes to the basis of our democracy, to our personal enrichment and fulfillment, of our understanding of this ever more dangerous world in which we live.  Education does everything that we need.  And it all begins with what goes on in that classroom.  If it's not effective, if we don't have the best teaching, it's not going to work.  As president, I intend to put a tremendous amount of attention on this.  I've spent a lot of my life in it.  And I don't think there's any other way of getting it done except with presidential leadership."

And just think how, had he kept it, some of his descendants might have been able to find an easier way to earn a living than running for a political office."

Its effect is to make the free world itself--both because of its freedom and because of its strength--a potent counter-attraction to Soviet power. And the emergence of this world, united, powerful, friendly and free, will exert an ever-increasing influence on the captive states within the Soviet Empire. "
6.82660925701832e-05,0.99993173390743,934_3,0,"In Illinois, we cleaned up, we disinfected, we fumigated a state government that had been the victim of eight years of magnificent rascality--and I mean Republican rascality. Now, actually it doesn't make any difference whether it is Republican or Democratic rascality; a bad public servant is a bad apple and you throw out a bad apple whatever its variety. That is what I believe and I think that is what we are going to do at every level of our government, if the people are conscious enough of what their responsibility is. But rascals in government are only the uglier practices of wasters in government. Economy is just as important as honesty--for a taxpayer's dollar that is wasted is just as bad as a taxpayer's dollar that is stolen. And here again I lay what I hope is not an immodest claim to some hard and educational experience in making both ends of a government budget meet, in keeping a government lean and trimmed down to an efficient size. I have some idea about that; as the product of practical experience in Illinois, I have learned that economy in government isn't just something that you say you are going to have. You have to grind at it all of the time. You have to grind--everybody--up and down the ladder; the purchasing officers who spend millions of the taxpayers' money, the fellows who deal around in government orders, even the girls who want to use a fresh carbon every time they want to write a letter. It is the same old business day and night. You've got to live it yourself twenty-four hours a day."

It is good of you to have come here today. I am happy to have this opportunity to come here myself. Much of our history has been written here in Connecticut, history of which we are all inordinately proud; history which reveals to us many risks."

You today accept the fact that, in the private free enterprise system which we all recognize as basic to our liberty and our prosperity, employees can prosper only as their employers do, and that irresponsible demands are only self-defeating. Yet American labor, like the Democratic party, faces new and uncharted tomorrows. You, as we, will be challenged anew to measure up to the demands of both freedom and power. The future of democracy, perhaps the future of our world, depends upon the exercise of power by America's private and public bodies alike with that self-restraint which separates power from tyranny and orderfrom chaos."

Pending better salaries, I made gifts of money to a few of these men on my immediate staff from political contributions. At least four of these men, while serving me in Springfield, have had offers in private employment of double or more of their state salaries. Some have had financial worries known to me. None ever asked me for help, and none could have been improperly influenced by these gifts, because I gave them and I appointed them to their jobs and I could have discharged them at any time. Two of them have left the state service long since--one to become vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and the other is now a justice of the Illinois State Supreme Court."

You remember the bitter winters of 1930 and 1931. Farmers in Arkansas--conservative, law-abiding farmers--organized to march on towns and loot the stores. Children left home to spare their parents another mouth to feed; so many of them left that the railroads put on special open boxcars to keep the kids from breaking into the closed ones. Millions of American men and women waited in the breadlines. An army of ragged veterans actually marched on our national capital. "

It has been accepted by the best men in both parties. No amount of election year talk can obscure that fact. What the campaign has clearly brought out is that the Old Guard of the Republican party wants to scrap that bipartisan foreign policy--and that their candidate with the new look, the General of the Army, has either forsaken his own great past of becoming the policy partner of Senator Taft and some gentlemen of similarly eccentric views about our world."

The issue then was whether the government would help make water available for small farmers who wanted to settle on new land. Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican president, put through that law, and we honor him for it. But as Theodore Roosevelt himself noted in his autobiography, he put the law through over the bitter opposition of the Old Guard Republicans in Congress. He observed that they consistently vote for local and private interests and against the interest of the people as a whole. And note, too that the original Reclamation Law was sponsored in the House of Representatives by Representative Newlands of Nevada, a Democrat. It passed by the votes of 77 Democrats and 69 Republicans."

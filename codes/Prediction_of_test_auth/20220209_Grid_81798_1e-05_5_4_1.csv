Are these the men we want to lead our nation in the struggle against Communism today? All the while they proclaim ferocious anti-Communism. Indeed, the best way they can apparently find to obscure their retreat from the fight against Communism abroad, the fight to keep it distant from our shores, is by shouting and screaming every hour on the hour about how much they hate Communism at home."
8.17593002783316e-05,0.999918240699721,1035_0,0,"Mayor Capeless and my friends: I hope the time will never come when I believe all of the nice things that introducers say about me. In all events, I am very grateful to all of you for being here this afternoon. I have just had a most interesting experience. I was presented on the rear platform of the train with an enormous placard--here it is--they are all of the Ike buttons, gathered by the Volunteers for Stevenson from people who have switched."
7.92779294442452e-05,0.999920722070556,1039_3,0,"Mr. Chairman, I just happened to run across one thing that a group was doing in some town in Illinois which is illustrative of what I mean by the variety of possibilities. They were merely beautifying the state highway at the access point of the city, where it began to come into the city. And where it had been shabby and ugly and messy they were cleaning it up around there and developing a picnic area--that sort of thing--and an infinite variety of things. Also, of course, from the point of view of the public official, it is a wonderful access point to communities."
8.48433170885617e-05,0.999915156682911,1039_6,0,"I am frank to say we have had very little cooperation from some of the veteran's posts. They are awful keen about this law enforcement, but they continue to use all these devices in their own posts. So it is a little incongruous. They say, By gosh, we are going to clean up crime in this community and get those slot machines out of that corner saloon. But of course, as far as our Legion Post, or VFW, or whatever it is, that belongs to us and it is certainly a different situation. And after all, the device is set to give the fellow at least a sixty to a hundred chance of winning as against one chance in a hundred in the commercial device; and, after all, we own the machine, and it is not owned by a syndicate of operators and placed on a rental basis. And so on and so on."
8.19496009582708e-05,0.999918050399042,1051_14,0,"I have been surprised to find that in some of the northern sections of the country there is a certain suspicion of Southerners. There is a provincial assumption--and fortunately not very widespread--that any man in public life in the South is bound to be a reactionary, or worse. If anyone can dispel this illusion, once and for all, John Sparkman is the man to do it."
7.79592270789105e-05,0.999922040772921,1074_2,0,"Then--then the people will vote on Tuesday. I understand that on Wednesday the newspapers plan to publish a Five-Star Final. Many thousands of our votes will come from rank-and-file Republicans who will vote with us. No doubt some Democrats will vote for the Republican candidates. We have already, for example, traded a couple of southern governors for the senator from Oregon and the vice chairman of the National Young Republicans. And I regard this as a profitable exchange for us. I would be happy to throw in a second baseman--but not Jackie Robinson."
7.81617368110091e-05,0.999921838263189,1082_7,0,"     And their voting record on farm policy is open for everyone to examine.  It is a record of opposition and harassment for 20 years, not only on price supports, but on all of the other Democratic programs on the storage program, rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, rural electric coops and so on.  The Republican Old Guard has never understood the philosophy behind these programs; it has never understood the programs themselves; it has never understood how they work.  The warning is plain; the Old Guard is hoping that the General can make his easy promises to farmers so convincing that they will forget about their own voting record."
8.12760621800631e-05,0.99991872393782,1092_14,0,"I don't know how thick your hide is.  But it's my belief that most Americans are ready to say, This is too much.  That is exactly what you and every other voting American will have the chance to say on November 4th."
8.50534876389232e-05,0.999914946512361,1092_20,0,"I started my troop duty in the days when we were digging trenches along the Mexican border.  In those days, war traveled no faster than a horse's jog.  I ended my last tour with troops in May of this year.  By then, the pace of war had stepped up to the speed of the jet plane and the impact of the atomic bomb."
9.713837699505e-05,0.999902861623005,1107_24,0,"Let me tell you plainly what I want to cast away, with the aid of a Republican Congress and Republican officials in the states. First, we shall cast away the incompetent, the unfit, the cronies, and the chiselers.  And it won't take years of Congressional investigation and a lot of tax money to clean out the mess."
8.59487963113322e-05,0.999914051203689,1127_31,0,"I will not support any amendments which weaken the rights of working men and women.  In seeking desirable amendments, I will ask the advice and suggestions of all groups--public, management, and labor.  And, gentlemen, I assure you that this invitation of mine will be genuine and in good faith.  It will not be one of those empty theatrical gestures so often made in recent years.  In my own mind I have complete confidence that this job of amending the law can be worked out so that no fair-minded member of your group will consider the results unreasonable.  No such legislation must ever be regarded as final, and in considering amendments to labor legislation, labor will have an equal voice.  It is the American way to take what we have and constantly seek to make it better."
8.43518261017755e-05,0.999915648173898,1130_24,0,"Next, I want to see maintained the Constitutional relationship between the federal and the state governments.  My oath of office would demand that.  My convictions would require it.   The federal government did not create the states in this republic.  The states created the federal government.  The creation should not supersede the creator."
7.97145796000654e-05,0.9999202854204,1156_13,0,"No one, not even the blindest partisan, can call this a proud record.  At times the pitiless pressure of Communism has been checked by brave emergency attempts that rallied men of all parties to make up the deficiencies in our national leadership.  These attempts have produced the economic help of the Marshall Plan and the program of military aid to Greece and Turkey.  Both were enactments of the Republican 80th Congress, the Congress so long vilified by the administration.  These measures have helped to steady both the economic and the nervous systems of our allies.  They could hardly have been expected to do more in the making of our foreign policy.  Dollars and guns are no substitute for brains and willpower."
8.26257267925527e-05,0.999917374273207,1156_41,0,"It is true, of course, that the American taxpayer is burdened heavily by Soviet threat.  But what the Democratic nominee confessed was that under the present administration policy the American taxpayer is dancing to the Soviet tune and not getting for his tax dollar a clear, coherent plan to do away with the menace of war.  The telltale wording of that statement reflects the surrender of initiative to the Communists."
7.56129687836344e-05,0.999924387031217,1159_5,0,"Finally, we come down to the source of trouble, the source of all this trouble, and the American people in my opinion are convinced, have reached a basis conviction that most of these troubles were avoidable, that we have been led down a garden path by an administration composed of men who were too little for their jobs, who did not have the intellectual capacity, the courage, the comprehension to come before the American people to admit a mistake and get to work to correct it, but they come before you with some new alibi for pretending the mistake never occurred.  They even call the great war in Korea a police action. Ladies and gentlemen, this all adds up to one simple thing--we have got to have a change and I am not expressing here just my individual opinion.  I am bringing to you what I believe I have seen in the faces and I know I have seen in the telegrams and the notes and the letters and the telephone calls of thousands of Americans.  We can no longer put up with that kind of leadership, a leadership that does not bring us closer to peace in the world and they well know that we can have no peace in the world as long as we have a government that cannot excite your pride.  Until it can excite your pride it is not going to earn the respect abroad that it must have if it is going to lead the world toward peace.  In my mind, that is the basic conclusion of American today.  Not only do we need a change, but we are going to have one."
7.75768978449718e-05,0.999922423102155,1179_4,0,"That record is a distinguished one.  It should be remembered that the negative votes on the North Atlantic Treaty, the Vandenberg Resolution and the Marshall Plan included negative votes of the party in power.  That is a tribute not just to a man but to a party.  Senator Vandenberg, if he were living, would be the first one to resent the suggestion that the votes to which I refer represented a personal triumph.  Rather, they represented to him the dedication of a party which, although it was an opposition party, subordinated partisan considerations to the national welfare."
8.75522840166219e-05,0.999912447715983,1216_15,0,"Now, let us talk for just a moment about these goals that all of us who are in this crusade are supporting.  Now, I do not mean just the purpose of supplanting a worn-out administration in Washington.  That is merely the first step.  This crusade of cleaning out an inept and bungling administration will take as its first job that of cleaning out corruption."
7.88263050438197e-05,0.999921173694956,1222_3,0,"If on top of that we have the military force we need then we are strong.  But how will we do all those things?  We will do them ladies and gentlemen only if we are a united people, united behind the great aspirations and purposes of our government.  And right there is the crux of the matter.  You must have a government that you trust, respect and believe in, if you are going to have a united United States.  A united United States would be a strong bulwark of peace.  A united strong United States can lead the free nations of the world into that kind of collective security program that will lift a great burden from our hearts:  the burden of fear abroad."
7.73983004597638e-05,0.999922601699541,1266_7,0,"But finally and more important than that, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few weeks I have gone up and down the length of this land.  I have promised farmers that when they have problems, bring those problems to Washington.  If the United States chooses to place on me and my associates in this crusade the responsibility for conducting the national governmental affairs during the next four years, each of these problems will be solved only after complete consultation with the people affected.  I have made that promise and that pledge to farmers.  I have pledged that to labor.  On Labor Day I said, The pledge that this crusade makes you is this:  We would be firm, we would be just, we would be fair, but we will be friendly.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is what I should say that a new administration could do instantly on this problem.  Not only could they bring in advice, general advisors and consultants on the whole problem of promotion of small industries throughout our country, but they could bring in specifically, from this area people of management and business and investment and labor, the men who are working and out of work, bring them in and say, Let us find out what we can do here, what can the federal government do legitimately without interfering with your lives, but in a friendly, helpful sort of way that will both to the benefit of the federal government and to this city."
8.29528056953765e-05,0.999917047194305,1285_30,0,And where are these bosses now and what are they up to?  They are where they have always been and up to the same things they have always been up to.  They are in the administration party and they aim to continue to rule it.
7.93289754184453e-05,0.999920671024581,1303_4,0,"The essential difference between this worn-out bureaucracy in Washington and the crusade is this:  They want to sit in Washington and direct your lives and your businesses and check up on you from thousands or hundreds of miles away.  We want to see you develop yourselves with every single thing you have got in you and hold the government ready to help you whenever it is necessary, but to work with you and not just to work you. We believe that if we bring to Washington the outstanding men and women of this crusade--your representatives, people coming right out of this crowd, men who have been introduced to you from this platform--that all of those people will be your guarantee that there is no crookedness in government, that subversion and Communism isn't getting inside of government.  They will be your guarantee that if a stray individual does go bad and betrays his trust, that kind of thing will be ripped out of government without delay."
7.83122185970505e-05,0.999921687781403,1304_4,0,"Just one or two items that are in this program of fear, and I will be on my hasty way through this section of New York state. They fear, they say, that these Republican, Independent and enlightened Democratic friends of mine will bring on a depression; that we may be able to lead the country toward peace, but if we do, there will be no jobs, men will be out of work, there will be breadlines--all that sort of bunk.  Now, the first thing that is necessary to lead our country toward peace is a strong America; and the first thing that means a strong America is an employed America--a prosperous America--that stands as an example of what free government can do for its citizens in this world.  That is the purpose to which this crusade is dedicated."
7.79455493661778e-05,0.999922054450634,1314_11,0,Tied to that problem is this one of Civil Service.  You put Ike and his friends in the administration and they will fire civil servants by the scores.  That is just bunk.  I have lived with those people a whole lot longer than some of the people who are now criticizing me and I like and admire them.
8.17865927117101e-05,0.999918213407288,1319_13,0,"Responsible union leaders have proposed programs for industrial rehabilitation and aid to distressed areas. The Democratic platform endorses these proposals. Senator Paul Douglas and other Democrats have already introduced bills in Congress to establish such programs. I hope that when Congress reconvenes they can, with a White House endorsement they have so far lacked, be enacted into law."
8.20064724966599e-05,0.999917993527504,1326_13,0,"Even more is it true that our hopes for peace in the world are still far from realization, the ultimate peace far from being won. I said earlier this week at the American Legion Convention in Los Angeles that: There is not peace--the peace we seek--while our sons and brothers are still being drafted for two years of military service, their schooling interrupted, their normal lives postponed."
7.90735836460871e-05,0.999920926416354,1327_2,0,"Well, the American people won't be fooled. What matters is not what it says on the label, but what is inside the package. And inside the Republican package is the same old stuff, the same Old Guard, the same old promises they make every four years. They still shine--but then, why shouldn't they? They've never been used."
7.99227538335088e-05,0.999920077246166,1342_3,0,"Yet only a few weeks later he made his unhappy peace with the party. That was when he said, on October 30, 1953, that he favored the election of every Republican over every Democrat for every office any place. And that is the course he has pursued ever since. He has not hesitated to endorse any Republican, be he a Taft Republican or a McCarthy Republican. The only notable exception was an Eisenhower Republican--Senator Wiley of Wisconsin, for whom the President didn't lift a finger. It used to be said that Mr. Eisenhower would reshape the Republican party. You cannot help but wonder today who has reshaped whom."
7.6506281576127e-05,0.999923493718424,1343_10,0,"When the Democrats were in power, the conservation and development of our natural resources was treated as a matter of current boards, if they survived at all. The projects that have been built are monuments to the hard and persistent work of your representatives in Congress, of men like John McClellan and Bill Fulbright and the members of your House delegation. But they have succeeded only when the climate was right--that is, when your senators and congressmen had the sympathetic support of a Democratic administration instead of determined Republican opposition."
7.5913483816284e-05,0.999924086516184,1343_6,0,"Four years ago, the voters could reasonably believe that Mr. Eisenhower's personal crusade would alter traditional Republican policies and, indeed, remake the Republican party in his own image. Today, the record makes it clear that this has not been done--and circumstances make it certain that it will not be done in the four years ahead. It was not, as some sought to suggest, the habit of the past that sustained your faith in the Democratic party in 1952. It was rather your vision of the future. It is true that Southerners have long memories, and many bitter things to remember. But it is also true that the South is caught up today in a rushing pattern of change that makes this in many ways the most exciting and the most promising region in our country."
7.90554509471567e-05,0.999920944549053,1349_8,0,"And I urge you to send a good man to represent the people of Indianapolis to the U.S. Congress, James Carvey. I want to say another word about the farmer. I don't need to tell you people here in Indiana what's happened to Candidate Eisenhower's promise to farmers four years ago--or what's happened to the farmer and the family farm. But I assumed a duty at the National Plowing Match at Newton, Iowa, last week that I want to perform here today."
8.07157837700107e-05,0.99991928421623,1355_11,0,We must work out a program that will mean real security--and dignity and meaningfulness--in the lives of our older citizens. There are great unmet needs for more schools and teachers for our children. There are slums to be closed.
7.88370549003437e-05,0.9999211629451,1367_14,0,"The Democratic party, in a free and open convention, chose as our candidate for vice president, one of the great spokesmen in this country today for the rights of man--Senator Estes Kefauver. The Republican party, in a convention that was not free and not open, threw out Joe Smith and, with President Eisenhower's blessing, nominated Richard Nixon. The contrast between these two men and the contrast in the manner in which they were nominated tells much about the difference between our two parties."
7.77982202814225e-05,0.999922201779719,1367_3,0,"We need strong, healthy, Democratic government in Washington as well as in Michigan. You have sent us a congressman who helps to give that kind of government--Don Hayworth. I know that you will all work and vote to return him to Washington."
8.08758096110576e-05,0.999919124190389,1369_5,0,"When there was a strike at the auto agency of this Cabinet businessman his comment was: I don't happen to go along with some of the goons they've got running things. Is that what they think of labor? When small-business failures reach an alarming rate, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior says, There are business failures even in times of great prosperity. It is part and parcel of our American way of life... I do not think we would want it different. Is that what they think of small business?"
7.63642578254889e-05,0.999923635742174,1377_5,0,"At Peoria, four years later, the President told his Republican audience that what he meant at Kasson, was that farmers should get their parity in the marketplace. If that means anything, it means they should get parity without price supports. And if that is what Mr. Eisenhower meant, why didn't he say so four years ago? He didn't say so because he knew that any such statement would have cost him."
9.02804762406686e-05,0.999909719523759,1378_35,0,What does Mr. Eisenhower propose then? That we go ahead with the development of the cobalt bomb to try to gain another advantage? A force that can shake the earth's axis.
8.17105864390756e-05,0.999918289413561,1384_8,0,It's a wonderful technique these Republicans have. A measure passes in spite of this opposition. And then President Eisenhower claims it as a Republican accomplishment. You might call this the politics of adoption. Or you might call it just plain deceit.
7.96169972215207e-05,0.999920383002778,1385_13,0,"Either the President and the Vice President did not know how serious the situation was in the Middle East, or they did not want the American people to know--at least, till after the election. And only last Sunday--just four years ago--Mr. Dulles said in a television interview that the United States, Britain, and France have developed a common policy, and I think it's amazing the degree to which we have had a common policy... and the fact that there are certain minor superficial difficulties as to details about just how you handle tolls, or how much is going to get paid to Egypt and how much isn't, doesn't detract from the fact that we have a common policy. The superficial difficulties of Sunday became pretty formidable by Tuesday, when Britain and France broke with the United States in the U.N."
8.44535602505246e-05,0.99991554643975,1390_6,0,"But when he doesn't run the store in foreign affairs, it is disastrous. Presidential negligence on questions of peace and war may plunge the whole world into the horror of hydrogen war. And negligence is precisely what we have been getting."
7.64188567252408e-05,0.999923581143275,1391_15,0,"And distasteful as this matter is, I must say bluntly that every piece of scientific evidence we have, every lesson of history and experience, indicates that a Republican victory tomorrow would mean that Richard M. Nixon would probably be president of this country within the next four years. I say frankly, as a citizen more than a candidate, that I recoil at the prospect of Mr. Nixon as custodian of this nation's future, as guardian of the hydrogen bomb, as representative of America in the world, as Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces. Distasteful as it is, this is the truth, the central truth, about the most fateful decision the American people have to make tomorrow. I have full confidence in that decision."
7.97186845528538e-05,0.999920281315448,1401_19,0,"This year, the soil bank is retiring over twelve million acres and earning a half million farmers more than $260 million dollars. When next year it retires forty to fifty million acres, overproduction will start coming under control. That means better times for every farmer."
8.09628510937578e-05,0.999919037148906,1424_5,0,"Now, permit me two observations. First, I offer a simple suggestion to any leader of the opposition. I suggest that, if I were anxious to win the confidence of the American people and remembering the Washington mess of only four years ago--there is one word that is the last that I would take from out the whole dictionary to use in a political argument--and that word is corruption. When this word is uttered in any political hall of the opposition, it echoes with a most curious ring. I know why, for I recall an old but grim proverb. It comes from the greatest Spanish novel ever written. And it warns: Never mention rope--in the house of one who has been hanged."
8.59316683541009e-05,0.999914068331646,1435_7,0,"I might apply this principle for you to the problem of civil rights. We believe, with the Constitution, in the equality before the law of every single American. In making this a reality in this day and time, we believe in cooperation. We believe that in getting the cooperation that comes about from willing working together of Americans, you achieve much more than you do just by writing a hard and fixed dictum of law and say everybody must conform."
8.99582995192177e-05,0.99991004170048,1436_10,0,"Abroad, the balance of power is shifting. There are new and more terrible weapons--new and uncertain nations--new pressures of population and deprivation. One-third of the world, it has been said, may be free--but one-third is the victim of cruel repression--and the other one-third is rocked by the pangs of poverty, hunger, and envy. More energy is released by the awakening of these new nations than by the fission of the atom itself."
7.46922548403303e-05,0.99992530774516,1462_0,0,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Mayor, Congressman Moss, Governor Brown: I want to express my appreciation to all of you for your kindness in coming down here and welcoming us.  This train is headed not only south, but it is headed toward Washington.  I think in many ways the election of 1960 comes at a time more dangerous for our country, more trying for all of us, a period of greater responsibility for every citizen than any election since the election of 1860.  In that time, as you recall, the great issue was whether this country could stay united, whether it would, in the words of Lincoln, exist half slave and half free.  The issue in the election of 1960 involves not only the well-being of the people of this valley, involves not only the development of your natural resources, but as citizens of the United States and leaders of the free world, we must be concerned about such far-off places as the Congo, India, and Indonesia, the security of those countries, as well as the well-being of their people.  "
7.92172464160104e-05,0.999920782753584,1482_2,0,"We want a country moving ahead here at home.  Last year the Soviet Union exceeded the economical growth of this country by three times.  Last year we had the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.  We've got a million and a half people coming into the market every year seeking jobs.  Unless this country moves ahead, unless we continue to grow, unless our defenses are strong, unless we're educating our children, unless we are showing in every way, in science, in space, and here in Texas, that this country is first, not to follow when or where, but first--and that's what the Democratic party wants to do in the 1960s."
7.97562851096609e-05,0.99992024371489,1486_8,0,"Tonight, we salute George Meany as a symbol of that struggle and as a reminder that the fight to eliminate poverty and human exploitation is a fight that goes on in our own day. But in 1960, the cause of liberalism cannot content itself with carrying on the fight for human justice and economic liberalism here at home. For here and around the world, the fear of war hangs over us every morning and every night. It lies, expressed or silent, in the minds of every American. We cannot banish it by repeating that we are economically first or that we are militarily first, for saying so doesn't make it so. More will be needed than goodwill missions or talking back to Soviet politicians or increasing the tempo of the arms race. More will be needed than good intentions, for we know where that paving leads."
7.68350713525721e-05,0.999923164928647,1520_11,0,"Fourth, around the world, when we and the Soviet Union are engaged in a great competition to see whether the world will be free or slave, we continue to persist in regarding the production of food from the ground as a problem, as a surplus, as a burden, when it is a blessing from the Lord. I think we need an administration which so regards it. We spend $42 billion on defense every year. Those ships sail the oceans. They protect us but they do not serve our people and the world. I do not regard the distribution of food around the world as a great burden upon us. I regard it as an opportunity, to use our assets in a way which will attract people to the cause of freedom. I am glad that this is our problem, and not starvation. I am glad we can produce more than we can consume, if we share it usefully, for we are our brother's keeper; and if we have great assets in this country, I believe we should hold out the hand of friendship. When hundreds of millions of people stagger through their lives searching for food and we have it, and we are trying to determine which way the world will go, I would rather see our food used in an imaginative way than to argue in kitchens or anyplace else. I want to help people and I want the United States to be identified with that cause as it was in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and Harry Truman."

Every time that we fail to meet our problems, every time that we fail to move our economy forward, we fail not only our own people, but we fail all those who look to us for leadership.  My judgment is that there is a very clear choice between the Republican and the Democratic parties.  They stand for different things, and they have stood for different things all through this century.  Woodrow Wilson, running in 1912, said that the Republican party idea of policy is to sit on the lid.  Franklin Roosevelt carried the fight in 1932 and 1936 and Harry Truman carried the fight in 1948, and on the issues which matter, housing, social security, medical care for the aged, minimum wage, development of the resources of this country, I believe the Democratic party looks forward.

Mr. Nixon could not run on the program that he runs on if he recognized our times.  He could not run on the program that our power and prestige is at its height, that of the communists at the lowest it has been, that everything is all right and being done in its proper measure.  The very fact that he chooses that as his campaign indicates that he could not suddenly reverse in 1961 and determine on action.  If he really believes these things he says, in my opinion he disqualifies himself.  If he does not believe them, and runs on that program, he makes the same mistake that Stanley Baldwin made in England in 1935 which almost destroyed Great Britain, by misleading the people of England in 1935.  He prevented them, by not telling them the truth, he prevented them from arming at a time when it might have been possible to prevent the disaster of Munich."

First of all, let's recognize a fundamental fact. You hear a lot of talk about the farm problem these days, and from a political standpoint it's a difficult one. But let's never forget that there is no greater asset that we have in our struggle with the forces of slavery than the tremendous incredible productivity of America's farmers. Mr. Khrushchev knows this. He told me when he got back to Washington that he was pretty impressed with what he saw on the farms in Iowa that he visited, and he has reason to know it and I'll tell you why: because here in the United States approximately 6.5 million farmers and farmworkers produce as much as 50 million farmers and farmworkers produce in the Soviet Union. That, you see, gives us a tremendous advantage which we must retain. But since we owe this to our farmers, we must see that our farmers get what they do not receive today, and that is a fair share of America's increasing prosperity, and this can be done. The problem is difficult. As I've indicated, I'm going to touch upon it in detail in Iowa on Friday and a speech in South Dakota at the national plowing contest the next night."
8.01844052868353e-05,0.999919815594713,1764_7,0,"And, as Mr. Khrushchev is visiting the United States today as he is attending the United Nations' General Assembly, it is well for us to look at the meeting there and to look at him to see what kind of man we are dealing with and what kind of policy America must follow if we are to avoid war. So, first, because he is a man who understands power and respects it, because he is a man who will use power if he can get away with it, to accomplish his ends, we must make sure that he never believes he is strong enough and that we are weak enough that he could start something without risking national suicide on his own part. And, so, the first necessity of leadership in these critical years ahead is that the United States must continue to be what she is today--the strongest nation in the world.  And, my friends, we must continue to maintain that advantage that we presently have, and the next president must be prepared to ask the American people for whatever was necessary to maintain it because through that strength in our hands, we serve the cause of peace.  We serve it because we will never use it in aggression.  We will only use it to deter those who would threaten the peace or threaten the freedom of others."

I'll tell you why.  Because we know him.  We know the Communists.  We sat opposite the table with them.  We know what they're trying to do.  Here are fanatical, ruthless men who are determined to conquer the world, determined to conquer it by any means, if necessary.  But when we consider them, then, we've got to recognize that they're going to cause us trouble--they're going to cause us trouble every time they can.

They are not like the people you and I know in this country.  They have an entirely different set of values.  They are people who are determined to conquer the world and they will follow no rules of the game whatever, and this means, in other words, that we need, in order to deal with them, to develop the strength, we need to have the realism, which will effectively stop their plans and stop them without war."

All the criticism in the world of the Eisenhower record in the field of foreign policy isn't going to fool the American people because they know what it is and they like it.  They know that in 1953, when Eisenhower became president, we were in a war.  They know that in these last seven and a half years we got this nation out of one war, we've kept her out of others, and we do have peace without surrender today and they want to continue that kind of leadership."

To that end, I have proposed a national program in support of education, emphasizing such elements as college scholarships for those who cannot under any circumstances afford to borrow and to pay back, tax credits or deductions to cover tuition and other costs of higher education, aid in school construction to provide needed facilities, and thereby to release local funds for raising teachers' salaries--all of this, however, particularly at the secondary and primary level, to be accomplished without compromising local controls of our school system."

Well, believe me, anybody who says America is standing still hasn't been traveling through America--I can assure you of that--as I have.  Look at this great area here.

The federal government, with its ability to raise funds on a national basis, should aim at reducing the discrepancies among the various states in their resources for the support of education.

We'd go into a labor hall that would hold up to two to three hundred folks, and maybe ten people would come, and we'd stand in factory shift lines, and nobody knew why I was there or who I was. And by the time I explained, I'm Jimmy Carter from Georgia, I'm running for president, they were already gone. We walked into beauty parlors and barber shops and restaurants, and on the streets and factory shift lines, later on, shopping centers, farmers' markets, livestock sales barns, city halls, county court houses. We talked a little. And we listened a lot. In New Hampshire and Florida, and Illinois and North Carolina, and all over the country. We had thirty primaries where you could win delegates. And I was in all of them. I didn't win them all. But because my base and my support was from the people, we built up a campaign organization that made history in presidential campaign politics in our country. Long before the convention even met, I had won the nomination of the Democratic party. Most of the delegates who went there for me had never been involved in politics before. But they believed in me and I believed in them, and I haven't changed.

Two of the people that I have relied on in this whole campaign to help me with the two key issues, just coincidentally, happen to be from Polish families. For foreign affairs, the only man who came to San Francisco to brief me before the last debate was Zbigniew Brzezinski, who is an expert on that subject and he helped me a great deal. And before the first debate, the only man who came to Plains, Georgia, to brief me on economic affairs was Jerry Jasinowski. Just a coincidence, but I think it shows an increasing acceptance in government, in politics, of the wisdom and the justice and the understanding and comprehension of people in this country, and a chance to terminate the subtle discrimination that quite often has been an obstacle to the full involvement of great leaders who have come from families who originated in Poland."

He did so well it makes me jealous, and I'd like to point out to you that he epitomizes to me a concept of the Democratic party. The first responsibility I had was to choose a vice presidential running mate. The first responsibility Mr. Ford had after the nomination was to choose a vice presidential running mate, and I believe that any American watching the debate last night could assess the difference in the quality of those two men. I would trust Walter Mondale to be president in a minute, and I'm very, very proud of him, and I told him last night I was.

One of the most vivid memories in my mind is 1968. The Republicans nominated Richard Nixon for president. The Democrats nominated Hubert Humphrey for president. Many people, as you well remember, had been for Senator Gene McCarthy, and when Hubert Humphrey got the nomination to replace Lyndon Johnson as president, a lot of Democrats said, Hubert Humphrey's not perfect. I'm not going to help him. Let him shift for himself. So Hubert Humphrey never went to serve in the Oval Office; Richard Nixon did.

The average teacher in America today starts at about $14,000 or $13,000 a year.  In some states it's far less.  I was in Florida a year ago, and I saw a teacher's schedule that showed a teacher who had twenty years of teaching with a doctorate degree made $17,000 a year.  I may be off a couple thousand, but I remember being shocked by the figure.  I have talked to any number of young people who went into teaching full of hope and found out they just couldn't stick with it, couldn't afford it.  I talked to a young man in New Hampshire.  I don't think he voted for me based on the returns, but we had a nice conversation.  He told me that, more than anything, he wanted to be a science teacher.  But he had a family of two kids, he was now thirty-six years of age.  He said, I couldn't do it.  I had to get out.  And I made double or triple whatever it was in the private sector.  What is happening today is that a lot of young, skilled people are not going into education.  The tests show that a disproportionate number are testing at the lowest levels of skills and aptitudes.  That doesn't mean a lot of them won't become good teachers.  We ought to have a society in which both in terms of the environment of teaching being honored as a profession and the pay, is such that the very best, the top of each class, goes into education.  I think last year--as I recall, in Los Angeles--I believe I was told that a beginning teacher there made $13,000 and a beginning policeman $28,000.  I don't begrudge the policeman's salary at all.  But we're saying something about teaching when we give it this low status, and, of course, our kids will pay and our nation will pay.  By now we should know that it is the product of the trained mind that is the greatest source of wealth in America.  It's more important than all of our national resources, everything.  That's from an economic standpoint.  But education, of course--that's why I use the word learning--goes to the basis of our democracy, to our personal enrichment and fulfillment, of our understanding of this ever more dangerous world in which we live.  Education does everything that we need.  And it all begins with what goes on in that classroom.  If it's not effective, if we don't have the best teaching, it's not going to work.  As president, I intend to put a tremendous amount of attention on this.  I've spent a lot of my life in it.

That's the real Clinton wish list, the true agenda of this president when it's not an election year: a massive pork barrel spending program. The biggest tax hike in history.

The other, I suppose, is prosperity. It is clear, too, that the position of our two major parties on these issues is precisely the same as it was and as it has been for twenty years. The Republicans say that they are for peace and prosperity, but they don't want to do anything about it.

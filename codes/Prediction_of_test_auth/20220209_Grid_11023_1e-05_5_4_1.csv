6.55337819621611e-05,0.999934466218038,1013_6,0,"Well, the best answer I know to Republican fears is Democratic facts. These facts go back, of course, twenty years. Youngstown was not, in 1932, a pleasant place to work or to live--and Youngstown was typical of most of the cities of America. The steel mills here in the Mahoning Valley were working at 31 percent of capacity. One Youngstown working man out of every three was unemployed. There was no unemployment compensation. The other two men worked at poverty wages. There was no minimum wage law. Those men worked in silence beside the furnaces. There was no collective bargaining act. The foreman's word was law. The working man had no seniority rights in his job and there was almost no collective bargaining contracts; almost no unions. At the end of life's work when you could no longer work, there was nothing. There was no social security. You only knew that one day--and you never knew when--there would be a pink dismissal slip in your envelope, and that would be all. If it was bad at the mill, it was infinitely worse in the street and in the home. Youngstown was one of the first cities to start soup kitchens. So desperate indeed did the city of Youngstown become that the City Council..."

6.19744766426797e-05,0.999938025523358,1023_6,0,"And I wish that these men of little faith could see America, as I have seen it; could talk to the countless thousands that I have had the privilege of meeting with, like you here this afternoon, all across our broad rich land during these past two months. America is a great, a strong, a wise, and most of all a good country. And I believe with all my heart that by these qualities, we can and we will safely in God's good time win our way to a peaceful world."
7.40745094728007e-05,0.999925925490528,1038_9,0,"First, we must recognize that not alone for Americans, but for men everywhere, body and spirit are co-principals of the same being. Each needs a special sort of ministry. Let us remember that, while Christ preached the doctrine of eternal salvation, he also did the work that needed to be done in the kingdom of man. He healed the sick, fed the poor, sustained the weak, and sheltered all those who were in want. So must we, I think, as Americans continue prudently to extend to the needy of this earth that material help which we almost alone can give. And we ought to do this not grudgingly, but with a clear recognition that it is far better to give than to receive. In a word, the first answer to Communism is not a lesser, but a fuller application of Judaic- Christian ethics to the neighborhood of nations around us."
6.50646099150055e-05,0.999934935390085,1039_6,0,"I am frank to say we have had very little cooperation from some of the veteran's posts. They are awful keen about this law enforcement, but they continue to use all these devices in their own posts. So it is a little incongruous. They say, By gosh, we are going to clean up crime in this community and get those slot machines out of that corner saloon. But of course, as far as our Legion Post, or VFW, or whatever it is, that belongs to us and it is certainly a different situation. And after all, the device is set to give the fellow at least a sixty to a hundred chance of winning as against one chance in a hundred in the commercial device; and, after all, we own the machine, and it is not owned by a syndicate of operators and placed on a rental basis. And so on and so on."
6.46326866804731e-05,0.99993536731332,1043_11,0,"There has been loose talk of a war of liberation to free the enslaved peoples of Eastern Europe. Such a war is unthinkable and would destroy the very people and the civilization that we seek to save. Yet the day of liberation will come, and there is much we can do in the meantime to help the unhappy people of Eastern Europe. Through the United Nations much is being done to rally the conscience of mankind. We can offer help and encouragement to those thousands of families and those individuals who are escaping, month by month, through the chinks in the Iron Curtain."
6.10384722331384e-05,0.999938961527767,1067_11,0,"I don't believe that these changes in the nature of business have been adequately recognized by everyone in government. I think we must sweep out of the corridors of government, at all levels, national and state, those lingering suspicions which are a holdover from an earlier and very different time.  This is a problem which concerns me very deeply, for I am convinced that both government and business must learn to live together in harmony, before an era of bad temper turns into something infinitely worse. We must avoid at all costs the bitter struggle of class against class, which results inevitably in a drift either to the extreme left or to the extreme right. And you and I know that either kind of drift would end up at the same dreadful destination: a police state with all of the horrors that we have seen in Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia. "
6.26431076450226e-05,0.999937356892355,1067_14,0,"We must do nothing that might array class against class, or citizen against citizen, in quarrels which tear apart our blessed American family. I shall do all I can to sustain a feeling of mutual confidence and understanding among all segments of our society. I see the American people rejoicing in their strength and sure of their destiny--and I see them from coast to coast--and for such a brotherhood among our people, I think everything is possible. "
6.12489041526901e-05,0.999938751095848,1081_7,0,"     We Democrats are for private and we are for profitable business.  We know America could not survive with any other kind.  We are for the dynamic system of enterprise which has grown out of the great partnership of public and private initiative in this country.  We are against socialism--creeping, crawling, loping, galloping, or even the make-believe kind that takes up so much space in the Republican oratory these days."
5.9167115239593e-05,0.99994083288476,1084_9,0,"I think you know and I know that they have never really been ahead at any time. They just throw so much confetti at each other, read so many of each other's editorials, and cheer each other's speeches so loudly, that they begin to think that everyone agrees with them. Well, they don't. And I think you can rely on the American people every time to tell who is really talking sense and who isn't. "
5.93718886320757e-05,0.999940628111368,1085_15,0,"No, I've seen and heard the deep-throated courage and confidence and faith of strong men and women and happy children--people who still believe in one another, in spite of all the timid, doubting men. And I thank them every one for the reception they have given me--for their infinite courtesy and their heartening friendliness.  I have asked you for your support for my candidacy. I ask you now for support of our common faith in this country. The confidence we've inherited is our greatest wealth, the source of our strength. "
6.1235384209399e-05,0.999938764615791,1106_4,0,"There is no other way to account for the reception given to a Republican nominee--and remember this, accompanied as his chief advisor by a Yankee Governor from almost as Yankee a state as you can find, New Hampshire--a reception in Atlanta, followed by Jacksonville, Miami, Tampa, Birmingham and Little Rock. It was always the same and usually, ladies and gentlemen, with the shout along the roadsides and in the crowds, Throw 'em out, Ike; give 'em Hell. That is a battle cry that has now been repeated vociferously, in Philadelphia, even more loudly in Minnesota, yesterday in Cleveland, and I assure you I heard it many times coming in from the airport only a couple of hours ago."
6.57250415155785e-05,0.999934274958484,1130_24,0,"Next, I want to see maintained the Constitutional relationship between the federal and the state governments.  My oath of office would demand that.  My convictions would require it.   The federal government did not create the states in this republic.  The states created the federal government.  The creation should not supersede the creator."
6.51908726115619e-05,0.999934809127389,1146_2,0,"The British over on the left couldn't break out of the fortified town of Cannes, and we didn't know what we were going to do.  A little sergeant--Sergeant Kuhlen--I will never forget his name as long as I live--came up with an idea.  He found that he could put some knives on the front of our tanks that would go in and cut off these hedges.  The tanks could come through straight and come through shooting, and it wasn't very pleasant for the Germans. "
6.0729072465283e-05,0.999939270927535,1155_2,0,"Ladies and gentlemen, the campaign in which I am now engaged is in conformity with the promises I made to those people.  I think that the administration in Washington has gone too far in damaging, indeed leading toward destruction of the kind of America we have known, loved and believe in.  That administration has not led us intelligently toward peace.  It is spending more than it earns.  Indeed, it earns nothing.  It is spending more than it takes from us in the highest taxes we have ever had, and leaves a deficit in the budget that further cheapens our money."
6.19046009941193e-05,0.999938095399006,1156_13,0,"No one, not even the blindest partisan, can call this a proud record.  At times the pitiless pressure of Communism has been checked by brave emergency attempts that rallied men of all parties to make up the deficiencies in our national leadership.  These attempts have produced the economic help of the Marshall Plan and the program of military aid to Greece and Turkey.  Both were enactments of the Republican 80th Congress, the Congress so long vilified by the administration.  These measures have helped to steady both the economic and the nervous systems of our allies.  They could hardly have been expected to do more in the making of our foreign policy.  Dollars and guns are no substitute for brains and willpower."
6.44621535188775e-05,0.999935537846481,1158_2,0,"I get up early in the morning and I talk all day long.  By evening my vocal chords are showing the strain and my disposition and everything else.  But then I think of you people who work not only on an intensive basis like that part of the time, but all the time, keeping the party together, keeping it financed, keeping it presented properly before all the people, and I realize what public service really means.  It is not just the limelight, although sometimes these lights are pretty bright, at that.  It is the day by day chore."
6.02245633596277e-05,0.99993977543664,1165_4,0,"Now, the government has stumbled and fumbled in failing to bring us closer to peace.  In the last seven years look what has happened to us.  We stopped the shooting war in 1945 the strongest military nation in the world, to say nothing of our academic strength and our spiritual, intellectual, scientific and moral strength.  We were the greatest military nation on the globe."
6.06921356932399e-05,0.999939307864307,1207_5,0,"First, the government you have must be one to excite your pride, to get you to unite behind it.  There can be no peace in this world until there is a strong America leading us toward peace--strong spiritually, economically, financially, and finally militarily. We are going to have that kind of strength only if we are united behind a government that excites our pride.  Such a government will have great prestige abroad; the free countries will want to join with us in establishing a collective security."
6.14309102962947e-05,0.999938569089704,1241_7,0,"They fear, they say, that a new administration, not of the Fair Deal type, would take away all our social security programs.  Again, what rot!  All of us have gone up and down the country pledging not only the extension of those programs, but their correction, to make good the losses you have already suffered through inflation--in your bonds, in your savings accounts and in your pensions--and above all, to save whatever value still remains in the dollar.  At least, let's not let it go down from a present worth of 52 cents until it would be worth only twenty-five cents or less. "
7.63285474422683e-05,0.999923671452558,1247_45,0,"This, then, is the faith that can heal those sick with doubt, comfort those afflicted with tyranny, refresh those wearied by freedom's exhausting battle. This is the faith--not in the fiction of the abstract common man, but in the wondrous fact that every man is an uncommon man.  He is the infinitely precious, utterly unique individual of living flesh, whose spirit has such strength that he can endure and survive oppression and poverty, disease and imprisonment, to keep alive his soul's love of freedom."
5.89563853993325e-05,0.999941043614601,1249_17,0,"There is a cruel duplicity involved on the part of an administration which has pledged social security for some, and then through waste and careless financial policies, has caused an inflationary insecurity for all. And now we come to another glaring example of our national leadership's failure to live up to high ideals.  I refer to the McCarran Immigration Law, which was passed over the president's veto at the last session of Congress.  A new immigration law was certainly needed.  But with leadership, rather than vetoes, we should have had, and we must get, a better law than this McCarran Act."
6.46185430990273e-05,0.999935381456901,1285_30,0,And where are these bosses now and what are they up to?  They are where they have always been and up to the same things they have always been up to.  They are in the administration party and they aim to continue to rule it.
7.25898438323853e-05,0.999927410156168,1312_11,0,"What is extraordinary is that the present administration continues to pretend that none of these things have been so--that everything that has happened--every stolen secret, every disloyal official--is, they say, just an unfortunate, almost insignificant, accident. We could make some allowance for them if they had the honesty or the common sense, or both, to admit that they had been deceived and to show a stern purpose of preventing similar subversion in the future. There has been considerable concern--and rightfully so--about methods to be used in rooting Communism out of our government."
6.41168104066571e-05,0.999935883189593,1313_9,0,"Every single member in this crusade is pledged to this idea: That at the first sign of any approaching depression, the full power of private industry, of local and state government, and all resources of federal government will be mobilized to see that never again will we have mass unemployment.  We are committed to the expansion and improvement of social security programs, particularly to saving what is left of our dollars so that your insurance policies, your old age insurance, your unemployment insurance and the rest of itdon't run out of your pocket through that big hole they call inflation.  Unless we stop that, there is no hope."
6.13341806276108e-05,0.999938665819372,1314_11,0,Tied to that problem is this one of Civil Service.  You put Ike and his friends in the administration and they will fire civil servants by the scores.  That is just bunk.  I have lived with those people a whole lot longer than some of the people who are now criticizing me and I like and admire them.
6.17816391023774e-05,0.999938218360898,1319_3,0,"No leader in our country has done more, I think, to make state government an instrument for serving the responsible interests of working people--along with all other human interests--than has your great Governor Mennen Williams. Nor has any voice in Washington in these past two years spoken out more plainly and effectively for the rights of labor than that of Senator Pat McNamara. It is a special privilege for me to join you in saluting here today, on its twentieth anniversary, one of democracy's truly great organizations, the United Automobile Workers; and its president, my friend, one of freedom's truest and most effective servants, Walter Reuther."
6.64191845054239e-05,0.999933580815494,1322_8,0,"Yet the administration had opportunities to do something about this pledge. The AFL and CIO presented them with a golden chance to do just this when it called for an international convention against the use of slave labor. Here was a chance to place the United States in a position of active moral leadership, to mobilize the full force of world opinion against the Soviet institution of forced labor, and to establish our sympathy with the cause of these valiant workers behind the Iron Curtain who had risked their lives in the effort to throw off the yoke of servitude."
6.26809925948445e-05,0.999937319007405,1327_2,0,"Well, the American people won't be fooled. What matters is not what it says on the label, but what is inside the package. And inside the Republican package is the same old stuff, the same Old Guard, the same old promises they make every four years. They still shine--but then, why shouldn't they? They've never been used."
6.17767198187102e-05,0.999938223280181,1337_28,0,"The twenty-six years of Republican government have produced a record largely of stagnation, of complacency, and of drift. The Republican leadership cannot hope to meet the challenge of the future--because it can hardly bear to live in the present. The pace of change is quickening every moment, with every new discovery in our laboratories, every new invention in our workshops, every new upsurge of human ambition and hope in the revolutionary turbulence of the world. To meet the challenge of the twentieth century we need every resource of imagination, of intelligence, of courage, and of faith."
6.09737509803578e-05,0.99993902624902,1343_10,0,"When the Democrats were in power, the conservation and development of our natural resources was treated as a matter of current boards, if they survived at all. The projects that have been built are monuments to the hard and persistent work of your representatives in Congress, of men like John McClellan and Bill Fulbright and the members of your House delegation. But they have succeeded only when the climate was right--that is, when your senators and congressmen had the sympathetic support of a Democratic administration instead of determined Republican opposition."
6.83354258240788e-05,0.999931664574176,1347_21,0,"The magazines and newspapers, which denounce government intervention most lustily, are all subsidized by the U.S. Post Office--but that is not, it seems, legalized or even creeping socialism. Nor do airlines, for example, complain of the assistance they get as mail carrier. The private power companies--surely among the most active critics of governmental activity--have no objection to the billions of dollars worth of government financed and directed research, experiment, and pioneer construction which is being made available free to the private builders of atomic power plants. Nor has any private company blushingly returned its tax write-offs for accelerated plant construction on the grounds that it is robbing the citizens of their tax money."
6.28559842395129e-05,0.99993714401576,1357_16,0,"The most obvious weakness, of course, is the ease with which our national forests, our wildlife refuges, our parks and streams, and public lands have been invaded and turned to selfish private purpose. But more important even than that, perhaps, is the shunting aside of men who are experienced and trained in a lifetime of conservation work, in favor of politician appointees. The agency that looked at tomorrow's needs for minerals has been disbanded--and nothing put in its place. The Soil Conservation Service has been weakened--and must be revived. We need the leadership that will look at the nation's needs for water, for areas of recreation in the great open country, for land, and forest, and streams. We need, in other words really to look together at the needs and resources of our common future."
6.19611510696659e-05,0.99993803884893,1366_2,0,"And if you think that's something I tell all the folks, I might tell you that my fondness for this state got me in first-class trouble two weeks ago in Miami, Florida. I was going full speed ahead when I heard myself saying, and you folks here in California know what I mean. They sure did."
6.72298466247103e-05,0.999932770153375,1366_26,0,"Mothers know about crowded schools and half-day shifts in many, many places. Farmers know what's happened to prices and costs and their diminishing share of the consumer's food dollar. The small businessman knows what's happened to his credit and his profits."
5.99965349628092e-05,0.999940003465037,1367_3,0,"We need strong, healthy, Democratic government in Washington as well as in Michigan. You have sent us a congressman who helps to give that kind of government--Don Hayworth. I know that you will all work and vote to return him to Washington."
6.18589261752017e-05,0.999938141073825,1374_9,0,"I believe that the need for this interaction--for this balanced and reciprocal cooperation--has never been greater than it is today. For our society is in a state of transition. We have moved out of the bleak past, when our problem was scarcity and our task the hard one of distributing too few goods among too many people. We are finally entering that age of abundance, of which we have dreamed so long."
5.90203724793219e-05,0.999940979627521,1377_5,0,"At Peoria, four years later, the President told his Republican audience that what he meant at Kasson, was that farmers should get their parity in the marketplace. If that means anything, it means they should get parity without price supports. And if that is what Mr. Eisenhower meant, why didn't he say so four years ago? He didn't say so because he knew that any such statement would have cost him."
6.52968286929346e-05,0.999934703171307,1378_35,0,What does Mr. Eisenhower propose then? That we go ahead with the development of the cobalt bomb to try to gain another advantage? A force that can shake the earth's axis.
6.31433940244377e-05,0.999936856605976,1401_19,0,"This year, the soil bank is retiring over twelve million acres and earning a half million farmers more than $260 million dollars. When next year it retires forty to fifty million acres, overproduction will start coming under control. That means better times for every farmer."
6.14955303421629e-05,0.999938504469658,1412_1,0,"We are also deeply grateful that so many Americans have signed their names that they are determined to do their duty this fall in determining the course of America, and are going to get their friends to do the same. I cannot remember any birthday that has been quite so deeply meaningful to me as this one. I thank all of you--Mr. Percy and Miss Dunne particularly for being the chairmen of this great evening."
6.25810712428481e-05,0.999937418928757,1417_24,0,"Yet in our labor toward the peace we seek, we must comprehend always its basic requirements and face up to them manfully. First: strength--spiritual, intellectual, economic and military strength. Second: unity--our clear awareness that the road to peace is one that all nations must travel together, else none can do so. Third: faith--a faith in the greatness of our purpose that inspires in all of us a readiness to work and to sacrifice that this greatest of all mankind's hopes may one day be realized."
6.07412931771848e-05,0.999939258706823,1432_28,0,"And so we continue to build our strength, not to wage war, but to be spared war. We can judge today the need of this strength by a simple question: would we feel safe or secure as a nation if we, say five years ago in the past, had already ceased perfecting our military weapons and even abandoned our military draft? That is no formula for peace. It is a design for disaster."
6.32121662189844e-05,0.999936787833781,1459_3,0,"Third, we must get on with reclamation and basinwide development across the United States. Fourth, we must appoint a Federal Power Commission that represents the public interest and not the private interest. Therefore, in the 1960s we need a whole new concept of resource development. So vast, so complex, and so essential are our natural resources that they cannot be parceled out piecemeal; nothing less than a comprehensive, basin-by-basin, valley-by-valley development of our natural resources, to make sure that not one drop of our water goes from the wellsprings of our water to the sea without being used for a public purpose."
6.19774317033115e-05,0.999938022568297,1466_12,0,"If the president does not set those standards, if he does not set our national goals, then a senator from Massachusetts, or a senator from California, or the governor of California, or a Congressman, or a newspaper editor, or a system cannot do it. Only the president speaks for the people. Therefore, the president must speak with the people and for the people in setting before them the unfinished agenda. "
6.22245879678378e-05,0.999937775412032,1498_13,0,"Fourth and finally, Mr. Khrushchev, it has been suggested that your objective is to divide our country in the middle of an election. Let me say, as emphatically as I can: those tactics will not work. You may try to praise or condemn one candidate or another. You may try to express, directly or indirectly, your preferences or your doubts, but the American people are not going to be influenced in this election by what the Kremlin does or says or does not say. "
5.97116027655393e-05,0.999940288397235,1573_6,0,"I think we will move in the direction of freedom.  That is the purpose of this campaign, to build a stronger country here, and in building a strong country, we strengthen the cause of freedom all around the globe. I ask your help in this campaign.  I ask you to join me in a journey across the new frontiers of the 1960s.  I run for the office of the presidency not promising the things I am going to do for the country, but asking you to join with me in serving our country, in making it greater, in making it stronger, in making it fulfill its manifest destiny. "
6.31096528535771e-05,0.999936890347147,1592_7,0,I ask for a national revival of our spirit.  There is not a student here--and it is nice to talk to eighteen and nineteen-year-old students who have the right to vote--there is not a student here who will not live in the most hazardous time in the life of our country.  And I hope that they will assume the burdens which go with the great responsibilities of maintaining freedom.  We do not want it said of them what Queen Victoria said of Lord John Russell.  He was interested in nothing but the Revolution of 1688 and himself.
6.02455581071189e-05,0.999939754441893,1598_13,0,"Franklin Roosevelt said in his second inaugural address, This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.  I believe in 1960 a new generation of Americans who fought for freedom on all fronts in World War II have now come to where they have a rendezvous with destiny, that their generation must bear its responsibilities of leadership.  I want Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans has assumed the leadership, a generation of Americans that is not satisfied to be second best, that wants to be first, not first, if, but, when, or sometime, but first, period.  "

Roosevelt, who was running in 1920 for the vice presidency of the United States, with Governor Cox of Ohio.  Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt then journeyed to Washington, D.C., and went to see Woodrow Wilson, sick, aging, and at the end of his career.  After Woodrow Wilson talked for a few minutes however, with great feeling and great fire of his desire for a unified world and a world of peace, Governor Cox broke in and said, We are behind you 100 percent, and they fought that campaign in part to implement the ideal of Woodrow Wilson for the establishment of the League of Nations, and lost.  But Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt, in losing that election in 1920, held before themselves and the people their concept of the service that they can render in an election, of attempting to turn the attention of the people to the great issues that face us, and the great possibilities that lie in action in the future.  And I believe in this election 40 years later, we merely do not run for office, but we also seek to establish a basic point, that what this country is now doing is not good enough, that in the 1960s, if we are going to maintain our freedom, if we are going to meet our commitments at home and abroad, we have to do better, and that is the basic issue which has separated Mr. Nixon and myself.

Now, as the market price drops so drops the support price.  Where you had $1.50 for corn eight years ago, you may be getting 90 cents for corn today, or 93 cents.  That is the market price.  Mr. Nixon will pay you 90 percent of that market price next year, and if it drops to 85 cents, he will pay you 90 percent of that, and that is the step, down, down, down, until farmers are driven off their farms in increasing numbers."

I just come here in this community, which is mixed, Democrats, Republicans and independents, because two weeks from today, November 8th, Mr. Nixon's and my work will be finished and then you have to decide, you have to make these judgments.  But what is the area of difference between us?  What is the issue on which you should base your decision?  You should not only make a judgment of Mr. Nixon and myself.  You should also make a judgment about yourselves, what you want, about what your view is of your country and your community, about what your view of the future is, whether you are satisfied today or wish to do better.  If you are satisfied, if you feel happy about your life, if you feel our country is meeting its responsibilities, then you belong in Mr. Nixon's camp.  But if you share the view that I hold very vigorously that this country is going to have to do better in the future, that we have responsibilities to meet not only to ourselves but to the cause of freedom, that we are anxious to make sure that in the future people decide that these days were great days in the life of our country, that we must move forward, we must stimulate our growth, we must hold out an image to the world of a vigorous, dynamic society, if we are going to continue to lead the free world--I believe that is the choice.

I'll tell you why.  Because we know him.  We know the Communists.  We sat opposite the table with them.  We know what they're trying to do.  Here are fanatical, ruthless men who are determined to conquer the world, determined to conquer it by any means, if necessary.  But when we consider them, then, we've got to recognize that they're going to cause us trouble--they're going to cause us trouble every time they can.

I stand here talking of experience but most of all, I stand here to tell you that my colleague and I, knowing the men with whom we deal, know that we can never rest for a moment on our record, that we must move forward militarily.

We've been hearing that America has been standing still, and it's said we've got to change our economic policies so that America can get going again, so that we can cross some new frontiers.  Well, my friends just let me say this: Anybody who says America has been standing still during the Eisenhower years just hasn't been traveling around America.  He's been traveling in some other country, I can tell you that, because look at this area; look at the state of Florida, the growth here in the last eight years.  I say that those who say America is standing still are making a fatal error.  They are judging the growth of America by what government does rather than what people do, and it's people who make America great, not just simply what government does at the federal or the state or the local level."

If you want higher taxes, if you want higher prices, you have a pretty good choice and a pretty good way to get them.  No, I say, we can have progress and that we will have it, but that the way to get it is not through programs which, in effect, will say, Turn over all these problems to the Federal Government.  Let us have your money and we'll spend it for you. The way to progress is for the Federal Government to do what it ought to do and what it needs to do, but not to spend a dollar that can be spent better by the people themselves at home right here in Marietta, Ohio."

One year my older brother wanted a pony; another year I wanted an automatic train, and so forth. We couldn't have them because much as my mother and father would have liked to have made a promise to give us those things, they knew they had a responsibility to the whole family.

Now, that doesn't mean that we won't always go the extra mile--and Cabot Lodge and I have some ideas for strengthening the United Nations, for setting up new organizations which can strengthen the cause of peace and freedom throughout the world. But, my friends, I can assure you of this: we are not, under any circumstances, going to enter into any agreements with the Soviet leaders which would surrender freedom any place in the world, because that leads to war and not to peace.

As I said here in Los Angeles last night to a large rally in the streets--I have no careful solutions to offer, and nothing that is strikingly new to say. What needs to be said once more all around the world is Let us stop the killing and stop the killing everywhere. Let us stop it here in our own land before we convince our own children that violence is in fact the normal way of life. Let us stop it while we still have the capacity to love one another as human beings--not just the few people right in our neighborhood, our own families and those around us--but people everywhere who, like us, want their years of happiness and life. But if I have anything to say about the course of events in the years ahead, there is one thing, above all else, that I would like to say and do. I would like to make it possible for a child in the Middle East, or anywhere else around this world, to live a full and secure and happy life before that child dies. I want to try to make it possible for that little girl in Vietnam that we saw running into the arms of the camera lens on fire from Napalm to be blessed by the warmth of love rather than the tragedy of war. I want to try and make it possible for people to live as though we really were created in the image of God rather than in the image of our worst fears and suspicions of each other. So I say Peace--not just now, but peace always. I say Peace--not just in one land, but in every land where there are men and women and children who don't know what it is to see a sunrise or to see trees in the springtime. I see and say Peace--on a planet which gives us life, among people who have no right to take it away from others. And I ask, as I did last night, that you say with me, in the words of that great prayer of St. Francis of Assisi, Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. And then we will reap all of the blessings that we, and the generations before us, had hoped for, and our children will bless us because we have given them the fullness of life.

And we would invite all the neighbors to come into the living room and meet with us--sometimes three or four people would show up. We'd go into a labor hall that would hold up to two to three hundred folks, and maybe ten people would come, and we'd stand in factory shift lines, and nobody knew why I was there or who I was. And by the time I explained, I'm Jimmy Carter from Georgia, I'm running for president, they were already gone. We walked into beauty parlors and barber shops and restaurants, and on the streets and factory shift lines, later on, shopping centers, farmers' markets, livestock sales barns, city halls, county court houses. We talked a little. And we listened a lot. In New Hampshire and Florida, and Illinois and North Carolina, and all over the country. We had thirty primaries where you could win delegates. And I was in all of them. I didn't win them all. But because my base and my support was from the people, we built up a campaign organization that made history in presidential campaign politics in our country. Long before the convention even met, I had won the nomination of the Democratic party. Most of the delegates who went there for me had never been involved in politics before. But they believed in me and I believed in them, and I haven't changed. And I want to be sure that I've maintained my relationship throughout this present campaign, and up until November 2nd, and particularly after January the 20th. I owe special interest nothing. I owe the people everything and that's the way I'm going to keep it."

Last month, I offered a comprehensive economic program geared at reducing the growth in federal spending, in taxes, in regulation, and in the money supply, and restoring predictability and stability to economic policy. These are steps this administration has utterly refused to take, but they will form the foundation of the Reagan-Bush economic plan.

First, the issue of trade. The next president must understand what 7 and 1/2 years of voodoo economics had done to America's competitive position in the world.  By driving up the dollar, it placed a tax on every product we sell abroad; and a discount on every foreign car and radio and television we buy at home.  It has turned America from the world's largest creditor into the world's largest debtor; made Middle America a shopping mall for foreign investors; cost more than two million good American jobs; and placed our economic future in the hands of the bankers and finance ministers of other lands."

The issue in the election of 1960 involves not only the well-being of the people of this valley, involves not only the development of your natural resources, but as citizens of the United States and leaders of the free world, we must be concerned about such far-off places as the Congo, India, and Indonesia, the security of those countries, as well as the well-being of their people.

397,44,"I see an America in which our neighborhoods are not filled with angry people, fearful of each other, but neighbors who care, and neighbors who know that they live in safety.  And I want to see the day when every American comes to that period in life that is known as the twilight of life will not only have the dignity that comes with happy retirement, but also, if he or she wants to, can do something rewarding for themselves and for their country.  And my friends, even more importantly, there are choices that are more fundamental about our society.  Is this going to be one America like this union--united and at peace with itself, or are we going to have two, four Americas, a nation divided against itself, the poor against the rich, the black against the white, the slum against the suburb, the North against the South?  Are we going to accept as inevitable the conflict, the bitterness and the hatred which threaten to become a part of our everyday life or are we going to do something about it?  Now, we can let those fears and divisions overwhelm us, and there are candidates for the presidency this year that may be counting on that.  Or we can choose a new day, the new day that I spoke of, where the man that is illiterate can have an education, where the person that is unemployed through no fault of his own can have gainful and productive work, where the mother who is on welfare but who would rather work if she could only leave her babies and her children in a good day care center--we can have a better America.",not populist,2020-11-17 10:53:28
398,1,"Mr. Nixon and I disagree on what is the best interest of our country, and you have to make your judgment on November 8th of what you feel, what you believe, the kind of country that you want in the future, the kind of responsibilities that you want to meet as a citizen, because he and I do disagree and these disagreements are important.  Mr. Nixon has run on a slogan that we have never had it so good.  It indicates his belief that we are moving in a period now, to quote him, of """"unparalleled prosperity,"""" that the United States is moving in a position of strength and vitality, and that everything that must be done is being done in good measure.  He looks around the world and he sees the United States with our prestige at an all-time high, and that of the Communists at an all-time low.  I look at the world and I look at the United States, and I don't see his picture at all, and I am not, as the Democratic candidate for office, going to run for the presidency in 1960 with any belief or any view that it is worthwhile getting elected president if we have to run on a platform which is totally unrealistic.  This country is not moving ahead like it is going to have to move ahead if we are going to meet our responsibilities to ourselves, to those who come after us, to those who look to us around the world for leadership.  And our position in the world is not unparalleled; our prestige has been higher.  Our strength relative to that of the Communists has been greater.  If Mr. Nixon hopes to be president of the United States and present the United States to the world in the same image that he now presents it in this campaign, I could not disagree with him more.  I hope you share the view with me that we want the truth with the bark off.  The people of the United States want to face the facts.  You share the same view that I do, that this country's potential is unlimited.  There is no responsibility, no burden, no hazard that the United States cannot meet, but it certainly cannot meet those hazards unless the leadership is prepared to tell the truth.

399,10,"I might add about the economy very briefly that now that we have an energy policy in place, it can serve as a foundation for the entire revitalization of the American industrial economy. This is important, because American workers now are the most productive on earth. But we've not been increasing our productivity enough in recent years. This must be continued.",not populist,2020-11-17 10:54:06

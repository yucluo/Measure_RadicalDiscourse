We are opposing it at home where its agents and converts seek to undermine our society and corrupt our government. As I have repeatedly said, the federal government must use all its resources to expose and identify Communistic activity, to keep Communists out of places of responsibility in our society, and to protect our institutions from Communist espionage, sabotage and subversion.

America is a great, a strong, a wise, and most of all a good country. And I believe with all my heart that by these qualities, we can and we will safely in God's good time win our way to a peaceful world."

It is a record of opposition and harassment for 20 years, not only on price supports, but on all of the other Democratic programs on the storage program, rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, rural electric coops and so on.  The Republican Old Guard has never understood the philosophy behind these programs; it has never understood the programs themselves; it has never understood how they work.  The warning is plain; the Old Guard is hoping that the General can make his easy promises to farmers so convincing that they will forget about their own voting record."

Lately it seems to be too much in the nation.  We do these things together because no one can do them for himself alone.  We must approach those group problems with a spirit of cooperation, a readiness to accept the responsibilities of each of us which are group in character.  If we do not do that then there comes that creeping tide of central law that finally results in the all-powerful state, and we do it because we are regimented.  Let us do our jobs at home, first in the family, then in the village, then in the state.  Let's not let the central government get any more of them than we have to."

In seeking desirable amendments, I will ask the advice and suggestions of all groups--public, management, and labor.  And, gentlemen, I assure you that this invitation of mine will be genuine and in good faith.  It will not be one of those empty theatrical gestures so often made in recent years.  In my own mind I have complete confidence that this job of amending the law can be worked out so that no fair-minded member of your group will consider the results unreasonable.  No such legislation must ever be regarded as final, and in considering amendments to labor legislation, labor will have an equal voice.  It is the American way to take what we have and constantly seek to make it better."

Here is something else we are going to cast out--governmental domination of the people it is supposed to serve.  When I talk about this you may get the idea that I am trying to be philosophical or highbrow, but believe me, this thing affects the lives of every one of us.  Like the rest of the things we will cast out, this too is a product of fear and lack of faith in the people.  This idea that government is the people's master is widespread in our world.  It is called by many names, but it always leads to the same destination.  It puts the gears of progress in reverse and carries society back to the days when the king was government and government was the final goal and the only power."

At times the pitiless pressure of Communism has been checked by brave emergency attempts that rallied men of all parties to make up the deficiencies in our national leadership.  These attempts have produced the economic help of the Marshall Plan and the program of military aid to Greece and Turkey.  Both were enactments of the Republican 80th Congress, the Congress so long vilified by the administration.  These measures have helped to steady both the economic and the nervous systems of our allies.  They could hardly have been expected to do more in the making of our foreign policy.  Dollars and guns are no substitute for brains and willpower."

We stopped the shooting war in 1945 the strongest military nation in the world, to say nothing of our academic strength and our spiritual, intellectual, scientific and moral strength.  We were the greatest military nation on the globe."

What I am discussing as I go around is the incompetent leadership you have gotten over the past seven years from your administration in Washington.  And I go into the various subjects of our lack of progress toward peace, our excessive expenditures on the federal level, the deficits that are cheapening our money, the crises that are going up, the taxes that grow more and more burdensome; and, with all of the necessary expenditures for defense organisms that we must have, still a kind of incompetence in government that gets two airfields in North Africa for the price of five and the kind of thing going on in the Justice Department that led an ex-under secretary, a high official in the Justice Department, to say only yesterday, Why, if my ex-chief should tell all he knew, they would blow the White House so high that the power of gravity could not bring it back."

It is the day that marked the adoption of the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution.  In that Bill of Rights it specifies what are the rights of human beings as opposed to the power of government, the limits of what government can do to the individual today, and those ten amendments, possibly coupled with the organization our forefathers gave us, is the real genius of American government.  When those rights, any one of them, comes in peril from within or any threat from without, it is time for every loyal American, not just the rich, not just the farmers, not just the workmen, but everybody.  It is time for every loyal American to rise up, take a look, gird himself for battle, and fight off the encroachment."

It should be remembered that the negative votes on the North Atlantic Treaty, the Vandenberg Resolution and the Marshall Plan included negative votes of the party in power.  That is a tribute not just to a man but to a party.  Senator Vandenberg, if he were living, would be the first one to resent the suggestion that the votes to which I refer represented a personal triumph.  Rather, they represented to him the dedication of a party which, although it was an opposition party, subordinated partisan considerations to the national welfare."

I am glad to have been here to pay tribute to its progress and its record in that field. Now friends, thank you again for turning out.  Let me bring out the better half of the Eisenhower tribe."

You know, folks, it strikes me that Senator Dirksen must indeed be a very powerful Senator when he can arrange by remote control such weather for this meeting.  I pay my compliments to him.  To each of you I extend my very warm thanks for coming here this afternoon, for giving me a chance to greet you, to say hello, and to express to you one or two thoughts that I have in mind as we progress in this political campaign."

Measures to deceive them worked so effectively that they estimated our original strength in Europe at seventy-five divisions instead of the actual thirty-six. In the entire American record in Europe there is no single instance where the enemy gained essential information of our plans through the medium of spies or subversive agents."

By this I mean the actual cost in dollars is something that you have to add onto all these wasteful and extravagant expenses, as well as the necessary expenses.  But the great damage done to us by corruption in government is, after all, not just the few dollars it takes out of our tax revenues and our pockets.  This mess in Washington lowers our prestige abroad and robs us of pride in our own government.  If we are going to restore pride in government, who is going to do it?  You can't take an organization that has been in power far too long and merely by doing a little face-lifting job, doing a little repaint job, get by with it.  Actually, I believe that the administration candidate said all it needed was a little refreshening.  But as far as I am concerned, how do you refreshen a bad egg?"

Which makes it all the more necessary that we watch with a jaundiced eye anything that is unnecessary--all of the waste, the duplication, the inefficiency that we know about, and which you would not expect me here today at this time to enumerate.  That must be eliminated and it is the second purpose of this crusade."

They will be consulted, and not the way they are consulted now:  You do this or you will get no more.  They will be consulted on what is the problem of their locality.  We have no intention in this crusade of getting a bunch of long-haired Brannan experts to come out and run your farms.  We figure you can do it a little better."

You have fulfilled the vision of those hardy pioneers who set up the early capital of the Texas republic down at the corner of Main Street and Texas Avenue.  You have vindicated their resolute belief in the unlimited future of this region.  Your growth has been phenomenal--the vast industrial development ringing the city; your beautiful churches; your Rice Institute; your University of Houston; your wonderful medical center; and your other institutions of culture and learning.

If you believe that as I do, will you join our crusade? This crusade which I have taken to the American people represents what I, myself, believe.  I have acted and I have spoken from my own deep inner convictions of what is best and right for America.  I have been steadfast to my convictions.  I have made no deals.  I am still a no deal man.

I have just been traveling the roads of Nassau County, and never have I been greeted with more cordiality, with greater evidences of hospitality.  I am deeply grateful not only to everyone who was along the road this morning to wave a cheery hello, but to each of you here who has come out to allow me to bring a word of greeting and to express to you one or two of the thoughts on my mind as we go through his political campaign."

It was this: There was quoted a top-secret document of the American Defense Department. How it got there, we will never know probably. But that top-secret document brought out one fact that really answers your question. It was this. There was a military estimate made in September 1947 by military men, and it had this conclusion: The military occupation of South Korea is not essential to the military security of the United States of America."

Rabbi Silver and Bernie Baruch and Cardinal Spellman took care of that one, and Judge Reynolds and a few others took care of it.  I more than ever pledged myself to see that we remove the remaining stains of discrimination from our national life.

I hated everybody who hadn't been born ten generations back in the United States, and they thought I didn't know any American Indians, so this looked like a pretty good one.  They said I was anti-Catholic, anti-Negro, anti-Semitic, anti-everything.  Well, that one I didn't have to answer, my friends.

They will keep on driving and expanding and gaining without regard to all the kitchen debates and without regard to what goes on in the United Nations unless we have a president and a country in the 1960s that acts first and acts fast.

There are 15 million American homes, according to the last Bureau of the Census, which are substandard.  Mr. Nixon has issued a paper on housing, and this, I think, is most revealing of all and one of the most endearing qualities of the Vice President.  In his position paper issued in New York within the last three weeks, he says that the Housing Act of 1949 has worked very well, and do you know as a congressman he voted against it?  In that position paper he called for greater emphasis on middle-income housing and he voted against that in 1950.  He calls for a greater flow of housing credit so that the American people can buy houses at low rates of interest.  But he neglects to mention his vote as vice president to increase the interest rates on the GI housing bans.  High interest rates never built a single home and one of the reasons why we are building 200,000 less homes each year than we should to keep up with our population increase is because of the high interest rate policy of this administration.

Mr. Nixon has chosen a different road.  He has gone to the American people in the 1960s, in the time of change and revolution, saying, We've never had it so good, saying our prestige in the world has never been higher.  I recall in 1935, when Winston Churchill was warning of the dangers of the Nazi rise, Stanley Baldwin, the leader of the Conservative party, told the people of England that everything was being done in its own good time.

What are the issues in this campaign that any voter should consider before they vote?  In my judgment they are two: first, there is the point of view expressed by the Vice President that this country has never been stronger, that our security is assured, that we are experiencing and enjoying unprecedented prosperity from one end of the country to the other, and that the way to win the peace is by journeys through Eastern Europe in order to inform them of the value of freedom.  I want to make it clear that Mr. Nixon may decide, if he is elected, to go to Eastern Europe, but I am going to Washington, D.C., because that is the place.

I think we must emphasize the things that unite America.

Let us at least draw some meaning that is lasting from their martyrdom. As I said here in Los Angeles last night to a large rally in the streets--I have no careful solutions to offer, and nothing that is strikingly new to say. What needs to be said once more all around the world is Let us stop the killing and stop the killing everywhere. Let us stop it here in our own land before we convince our own children that violence is in fact the normal way of life. Let us stop it while we still have the capacity to love one another as human beings--not just the few people right in our neighborhood, our own families and those around us--but people everywhere who, like us, want their years of happiness and life. But if I have anything to say about the course of events in the years ahead, there is one thing, above all else, that I would like to say and do. I would like to make it possible for a child in the Middle East, or anywhere else around this world, to live a full and secure and happy life before that child dies. I want to try to make it possible for that little girl in Vietnam that we saw running into the arms of the camera lens on fire from Napalm to be blessed by the warmth of love rather than the tragedy of war. I want to try and make it possible for people to live as though we really were created in the image of God rather than in the image of our worst fears and suspicions of each other. So I say Peace--not just now, but peace always. I say Peace--not just in one land, but in every land where there are men and women and children who don't know what it is to see a sunrise or to see trees in the springtime. I see and say Peace--on a planet which gives us life, among people who have no right to take it away from others. And I ask, as I did last night, that you say with me, in the words of that great prayer of St. Francis of Assisi, Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. And then we will reap all of the blessings that we, and the generations before us, had hoped for, and our children will bless us because we have given them the fullness of life.

The average teacher in America today starts at about $14,000 or $13,000 a year.  In some states it's far less.  I was in Florida a year ago, and I saw a teacher's schedule that showed a teacher who had twenty years of teaching with a doctorate degree made $17,000 a year.  I may be off a couple thousand, but I remember being shocked by the figure.  I have talked to any number of young people who went into teaching full of hope and found out they just couldn't stick with it, couldn't afford it.  I talked to a young man in New Hampshire.  I don't think he voted for me based on the returns, but we had a nice conversation.  He told me that, more than anything, he wanted to be a science teacher.  But he had a family of two kids, he was now thirty-six years of age.  He said, I couldn't do it.  I had to get out.  And I made double or triple whatever it was in the private sector.  What is happening today is that a lot of young, skilled people are not going into education.  The tests show that a disproportionate number are testing at the lowest levels of skills and aptitudes.  That doesn't mean a lot of them won't become good teachers.  We ought to have a society in which both in terms of the environment of teaching being honored as a profession and the pay, is such that the very best, the top of each class, goes into education.  I think last year--as I recall, in Los Angeles--I believe I was told that a beginning teacher there made $13,000 and a beginning policeman $28,000.  I don't begrudge the policeman's salary at all.  But we're saying something about teaching when we give it this low status, and, of course, our kids will pay and our nation will pay.  By now we should know that it is the product of the trained mind that is the greatest source of wealth in America.  It's more important than all of our national resources, everything.  That's from an economic standpoint.  But education, of course--that's why I use the word learning--goes to the basis of our democracy, to our personal enrichment and fulfillment, of our understanding of this ever more dangerous world in which we live.  Education does everything that we need.  And it all begins with what goes on in that classroom.  If it's not effective, if we don't have the best teaching, it's not going to work.  As president, I intend to put a tremendous amount of attention on this.  I've spent a lot of my life in it.  And I don't think there's any other way of getting it done except with presidential leadership."

And that need for hospital and clinical facilities is by no means satisfied, as every doctor will agree. I am talking, too, about a sound program which I hope we can develop to reduce the financial hazards of serious illness and remove the fear of husbands and fathers that a sudden accident or sickness will force his family on to public charity. And I don't mean what has been called socialized medicine either."

And it is against Democrats, so far as I can see, not after a sober and considered review of the alternatives, but automatically, as dogs are against cats. As soon as a newspaper--I speak of the great majority, not of the enlightened ten percent--sees a Democratic candidate it is filled with an unconquerable yen to chase him up an alley. "

Now, actually it doesn't make any difference whether it is Republican or Democratic rascality; a bad public servant is a bad apple and you throw out a bad apple whatever its variety. That is what I believe and I think that is what we are going to do at every level of our government, if the people are conscious enough of what their responsibility is. But rascals in government are only the uglier practices of wasters in government. Economy is just as important as honesty--for a taxpayer's dollar that is wasted is just as bad as a taxpayer's dollar that is stolen. And here again I lay what I hope is not an immodest claim to some hard and educational experience in making both ends of a government budget meet, in keeping a government lean and trimmed down to an efficient size. I have some idea about that; as the product of practical experience in Illinois, I have learned that economy in government isn't just something that you say you are going to have. You have to grind at it all of the time. You have to grind--everybody--up and down the ladder; the purchasing officers who spend millions of the taxpayers' money, the fellows who deal around in government orders, even the girls who want to use a fresh carbon every time they want to write a letter. It is the same old business day and night. You've got to live it yourself twenty-four hours a day."

Those who let their politics impeach their honesty tell you that inflation is the product of governmental waste and mismanagement. Whether this is legitimate politics I shall not presume to say. But as an explanation of the causes of inflation, it is pure poppycock. It's like a husband coming into the kitchen, seeing one potato peeling that is too thick, and exploding that now he knows why you can't make ends meet. I'm for the government's peeling its potatoes with a sharp knife and a miserly eye. And I've done some sharp and miserly peeling in Illinois myself. But I'm not going to fool myself or you that meeting a nation's inflation problem is that simple."

Pending better salaries, I made gifts of money to a few of these men on my immediate staff from political contributions. At least four of these men, while serving me in Springfield, have had offers in private employment of double or more of their state salaries. Some have had financial worries known to me. None ever asked me for help, and none could have been improperly influenced by these gifts, because I gave them and I appointed them to their jobs and I could have discharged them at any time. Two of them have left the state service long since--one to become vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and the other is now a justice of the Illinois State Supreme Court."

It seems to me that it is becoming pretty clear that there are two basic things in people's minds as the election in this fateful year of 1952 approaches. One of them is peace.

Two years later they gained control of the Eightieth Congress. They had a chance to make good on their promise. Did they make good? They not only did not fulfill that pledge--they actually took social security coverage away from more than a half million people."

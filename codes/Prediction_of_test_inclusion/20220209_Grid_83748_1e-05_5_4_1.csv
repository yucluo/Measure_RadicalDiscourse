Youngstown was not, in 1932, a pleasant place to work or to live--and Youngstown was typical of most of the cities of America. The steel mills here in the Mahoning Valley were working at 31 percent of capacity. One Youngstown working man out of every three was unemployed. There was no unemployment compensation. The other two men worked at poverty wages. There was no minimum wage law. Those men worked in silence beside the furnaces. There was no collective bargaining act. The foreman's word was law. The working man had no seniority rights in his job and there was almost no collective bargaining contracts; almost no unions. At the end of life's work when you could no longer work, there was nothing. There was no social security. You only knew that one day--and you never knew when--there would be a pink dismissal slip in your envelope, and that would be all. If it was bad at the mill, it was infinitely worse in the street and in the home. Youngstown was one of the first cities to start soup kitchens. So desperate indeed did the city of Youngstown become that the City Council..."

And somewhere in this process America has fundamentally changed--a new view, a new compassion, a new faith has emerged. In a way it is a moral revival, and it has altered the tone and the meaning of our life. And how different a prospect faces a young man or a young woman of today from what faced the youth of my generation. The only or, most of all, the go-getter was the hero. Few cared about politics or public service -almost none who went through school or college with me took any positive interest in that, or have subsequently. Few had the sense of civil or social responsibility that we find today, when they were young."

They just throw so much confetti at each other, read so many of each other's editorials, and cheer each other's speeches so loudly, that they begin to think that everyone agrees with them.

My first two days were spent in six southern cities. I was interested to see what were the subjects that seemed to interest them most, subjects involving national problems and the national scene, and then to compare those with similar reactions in the north. In my opinion they are identical."

Once we have gotten that thought in our minds so that we never forget it, ladies and gentlemen, we can clean out corruption.  Why, think of it, think of the votes we can roll up on November 4th.  We can bring down taxes; we can stop the terrific taxes that are piling up your prices.  An economist came into me the other day, one of these fellows, you know, that dig out the facts.  Every time you eat a boiled egg, unless you raise it yourself, you pay 100 taxes on that egg, one hundred taxes and then we wonder where the prices come from."

Young people with their idealism, their faith and their hopes must have a fair chance to shape the nation which will be theirs."

You people pitched in on your own.  You didn't even wait for a Washington bureaucrat to come down and do it.  You did it yourselves.  Moreover, I am told what you could expect in that little incident, that the elephant stayed on the job working until the last and the donkey played out--just too old, too tired."

At times the pitiless pressure of Communism has been checked by brave emergency attempts that rallied men of all parties to make up the deficiencies in our national leadership.  These attempts have produced the economic help of the Marshall Plan and the program of military aid to Greece and Turkey.  Both were enactments of the Republican 80th Congress, the Congress so long vilified by the administration.  These measures have helped to steady both the economic and the nervous systems of our allies.  They could hardly have been expected to do more in the making of our foreign policy.  Dollars and guns are no substitute for brains and willpower."

They even call the great war in Korea a police action. Ladies and gentlemen, this all adds up to one simple thing--we have got to have a change and I am not expressing here just my individual opinion.  I am bringing to you what I believe I have seen in the faces and I know I have seen in the telegrams and the notes and the letters and the telephone calls of thousands of Americans.  We can no longer put up with that kind of leadership, a leadership that does not bring us closer to peace in the world and they well know that we can have no peace in the world as long as we have a government that cannot excite your pride.  Until it can excite your pride it is not going to earn the respect abroad that it must have if it is going to lead the world toward peace.  In my mind, that is the basic conclusion of American today.  Not only do we need a change, but we are going to have one."

What I am discussing as I go around is the incompetent leadership you have gotten over the past seven years from your administration in Washington.  And I go into the various subjects of our lack of progress toward peace, our excessive expenditures on the federal level, the deficits that are cheapening our money, the crises that are going up, the taxes that grow more and more burdensome; and, with all of the necessary expenditures for defense organisms that we must have, still a kind of incompetence in government that gets two airfields in North Africa for the price of five and the kind of thing going on in the Justice Department that led an ex-under secretary, a high official in the Justice Department, to say only yesterday, Why, if my ex-chief should tell all he knew, they would blow the White House so high that the power of gravity could not bring it back."

Another of those blanks is that the Republican leaders would like to abolish all the gains that labor has made through these last years since the beginning of the century.  Ladies and gentlemen, sheer bunk!  I am not going to take time this morning to outline what the Republican Party is attempting to do in establishing the kind of climate in Washington where the labor-management problems can be settled without strikes, but I am going to repeat just briefly the promise I made to labor on Labor Day.  I said something to this effect: that four years from now, if you people had decided this fall to establish a Republican administration in Washington in the Executive Department, in the Senate of the United States, and in the Congress, that the leaders of that group would hope to stand before a crowd like this at the end of those four years, and each of you could look at the other and honestly say, Those people were fair; they were just; they settled everything on the basis of what is good for the United States of America, not just some particular section or group whose votes they were trying to buy--what was good for the United States of America.  Moreover, they would say and you would say to each other, They protected the rights of all--labor, management, professional men, farmers, everyone.  And finally, you would say, And besides being fair and just, they were friendly.  They were just people who belonged to us, one of us, not a bunch of long-haired bureaucrats in Washington who wanted to rule our lives from 3,000 miles away.  That was the pledge I made and I make it everywhere I go."

We will do them ladies and gentlemen only if we are a united people, united behind the great aspirations and purposes of our government.  And right there is the crux of the matter.  You must have a government that you trust, respect and believe in, if you are going to have a united United States.  A united United States would be a strong bulwark of peace.  A united strong United States can lead the free nations of the world into that kind of collective security program that will lift a great burden from our hearts:  the burden of fear abroad."

They will be consulted, and not the way they are consulted now:  You do this or you will get no more.  They will be consulted on what is the problem of their locality.  We have no intention in this crusade of getting a bunch of long-haired Brannan experts to come out and run your farms.  We figure you can do it a little better."

And now we come to another glaring example of our national leadership's failure to live up to high ideals.  I refer to the McCarran Immigration Law, which was passed over the president's veto at the last session of Congress.  A new immigration law was certainly needed.  But with leadership, rather than vetoes, we should have had, and we must get, a better law than this McCarran Act."

We want to see you develop yourselves with every single thing you have got in you and hold the government ready to help you whenever it is necessary, but to work with you and not just to work you.

Now, the first thing that is necessary to lead our country toward peace is a strong America; and the first thing that means a strong America is an employed America--a prosperous America--that stands as an example of what free government can do for its citizens in this world.

There are now within the department of state certain studies and certain polls which have been made of our position overseas.  The state department has been reluctant and unwilling to release them, even though they have been paid for by the taxpayers of the United States, and even though the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Fulbright, has asked that they be made public, for our information.  Mr. Nixon said that he had no objection, and I will quote him: He would have no objection to making them public.

Mr. Nixon could not run on the program that he runs on if he recognized our times.  He could not run on the program that our power and prestige is at its height, that of the communists at the lowest it has been, that everything is all right and being done in its proper measure.  The very fact that he chooses that as his campaign indicates that he could not suddenly reverse in 1961 and determine on action.  If he really believes these things he says, in my opinion he disqualifies himself.  If he does not believe them, and runs on that program, he makes the same mistake that Stanley Baldwin made in England in 1935 which almost destroyed Great Britain, by misleading the people of England in 1935.  He prevented them, by not telling them the truth, he prevented them from arming at a time when it might have been possible to prevent the disaster of Munich."

First of all, let's recognize a fundamental fact. You hear a lot of talk about the farm problem these days, and from a political standpoint it's a difficult one. But let's never forget that there is no greater asset that we have in our struggle with the forces of slavery than the tremendous incredible productivity of America's farmers. Mr. Khrushchev knows this. He told me when he got back to Washington that he was pretty impressed with what he saw on the farms in Iowa that he visited, and he has reason to know it and I'll tell you why: because here in the United States approximately 6.5 million farmers and farmworkers produce as much as 50 million farmers and farmworkers produce in the Soviet Union. That, you see, gives us a tremendous advantage which we must retain. But since we owe this to our farmers, we must see that our farmers get what they do not receive today, and that is a fair share of America's increasing prosperity, and this can be done. The problem is difficult. As I've indicated, I'm going to touch upon it in detail in Iowa on Friday and a speech in South Dakota at the national plowing contest the next night."

We will stop the Obama war on coal, the disdain for oil, and the effort to crimp natural gas by federal regulation of the very technology that produces it. We will support nuclear and renewables, but phase out subsidies once an industry is on its feet.

What needs to be said once more all around the world is Let us stop the killing and stop the killing everywhere. Let us stop it here in our own land before we convince our own children that violence is in fact the normal way of life. Let us stop it while we still have the capacity to love one another as human beings--not just the few people right in our neighborhood, our own families and those around us--but people everywhere who, like us, want their years of happiness and life.

I would like to make it possible for a child in the Middle East, or anywhere else around this world, to live a full and secure and happy life before that child dies. I want to try to make it possible for that little girl in Vietnam that we saw running into the arms of the camera lens on fire from Napalm to be blessed by the warmth of love rather than the tragedy of war. I want to try and make it possible for people to live as though we really were created in the image of God rather than in the image of our worst fears and suspicions of each other.

I say Peace--not just in one land, but in every land where there are men and women and children who don't know what it is to see a sunrise or to see trees in the springtime. I see and say Peace--on a planet which gives us life, among people who have no right to take it away from others. And I ask, as I did last night, that you say with me, in the words of that great prayer of St. Francis of Assisi, Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. And then we will reap all of the blessings that we, and the generations before us, had hoped for, and our children will bless us because we have given them the fullness of life.

The other, I suppose, is prosperity. It is clear, too, that the position of our two major parties on these issues is precisely the same as it was and as it has been for twenty years. The Republicans say that they are for peace and prosperity, but they don't want to do anything about it.

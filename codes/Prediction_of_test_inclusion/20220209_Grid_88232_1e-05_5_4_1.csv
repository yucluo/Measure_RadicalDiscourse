We are opposing it at home where its agents and converts seek to undermine our society and corrupt our government. As I have repeatedly said, the federal government must use all its resources to expose and identify Communistic activity, to keep Communists out of places of responsibility in our society, and to protect our institutions from Communist espionage, sabotage and subversion.

And somewhere in this process America has fundamentally changed--a new view, a new compassion, a new faith has emerged. In a way it is a moral revival, and it has altered the tone and the meaning of our life. And how different a prospect faces a young man or a young woman of today from what faced the youth of my generation. The only or, most of all, the go-getter was the hero. Few cared about politics or public service -almost none who went through school or college with me took any positive interest in that, or have subsequently. Few had the sense of civil or social responsibility that we find today, when they were young."

In fighting Communists at home, I shall rely on such experienced guardians of our security as J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and General Bedell Smith of the Central Intelligence Agency. These men fight Communism as it must be fought--with care, thoroughness, precision--and silence."

They are awful keen about this law enforcement, but they continue to use all these devices in their own posts. So it is a little incongruous. They say, By gosh, we are going to clean up crime in this community and get those slot machines out of that corner saloon. But of course, as far as our Legion Post, or VFW, or whatever it is, that belongs to us and it is certainly a different situation. And after all, the device is set to give the fellow at least a sixty to a hundred chance of winning as against one chance in a hundred in the commercial device; and, after all, we own the machine, and it is not owned by a syndicate of operators and placed on a rental basis. And so on and so on."

And one reason for this is that it has become harder and harder instead of easier and easier to tell precisely what the Republican party stands for in this campaign. I confess it is early in the morning to be harsh about anybody and to be very critical of anybody. I don't want to be critical or harsh. I have in mind that we are now only a week from our election and we still don't know precisely what the Republicans propose to do about much of anything. We know where they stand on the matter of a new labor relations law, for example. That is precisely where they stood for the past five years. That is an old Republican position."

That is why one can believe that the importance of bolstering our defenses by the foreign aid programs--Point Four, and things of that kind--are essential if we are going to hope to frustrate the designs of this godless tyranny throughout the world. I thank you so much for affording me this opportunity of participating even briefly in the ceremonies. I count you very fortunate indeed to have this splendid housing development in your neighborhood; and I can add that I am very jealous of it. I should like to be participating in a similar project in Chicago where we too have desperate need of the advantages of public housing."

And we are going to continue to shout and do what we think is right to extend the gains that we have made here at home, and to fight for peace abroad. In the conduct of our foreign affairs we will suffer no tyranny over us, just as we will suffer no tyranny of one American over another.  We want to impose no tyranny on any other people.  We will remain free ourselves--more so.  We will find, as we have found before, the balance between the power we generate and the brakes that will check the power of those hostile to us.  In this way we can move in the wide open world as our fathers did when our nation was founded, and we can move unafraid.  I am reluctant to stop, although I have talked entirely too much, both here and all throughout this campaign.  All the same I have left much unsaid that is in my heart.  All I can do now is to thank all of you and, through you, thank all Americans for the privilege of your attention in these past months."

It was always the same and usually, ladies and gentlemen, with the shout along the roadsides and in the crowds, Throw 'em out, Ike; give 'em Hell. That is a battle cry that has now been repeated vociferously, in Philadelphia, even more loudly in Minnesota, yesterday in Cleveland, and I assure you I heard it many times coming in from the airport only a couple of hours ago."

It makes certain that every time you come back you think more of this country.  If there is any veteran in this whole crowd who didn't have that same feeling when he came stemming into New York or San Francisco or Seattle or Norfolk, then I would be astonished because I have never yet met one who has not said, Well, one good thing a tour abroad does for you; it makes you understand how well worthwhile it is working here at home."

A little sergeant--Sergeant Kuhlen--I will never forget his name as long as I live--came up with an idea.  He found that he could put some knives on the front of our tanks that would go in and cut off these hedges.

If we do not stop that kind of thing, ladies and gentlemen, then America cannot be what it has been in the past.  We must have a solvent America, an America that lives within its means, yet so far have they gone with these spendthrift policies that the government itself says that last year every city family had to spend $400 more than that family could earn to pay for its shelter, its food, its clothing and other necessities in the family.  If that goes on, not only is this government going to be broke but all the families in it are going to be broke.  That is not America."

But then I think of you people who work not only on an intensive basis like that part of the time, but all the time, keeping the party together, keeping it financed, keeping it presented properly before all the people, and I realize what public service really means.

Sheer bunk!  What the Republicans have said is this:  our purpose is to keep the dollar from going down further so that there will be no further erosion of your savings account, of your bank account, of your insurance policy and of your bonds.  But instead of seeing those things go down the drain of inflation you will keep them, and moreover they have said that where inflation has already overtaken some of these things, these amounts, and they have gone down below decency, that must be corrected, which means corrected upward.  They have also pledged in their platform to expand social security to go to classes not so far covered."

Well, some things are so false you don't know the right words to use, at least in polite society, for condemning them.  I went to Kasson and on behalf of Republican leaders, and with the concurrence of the great men of the party, at least all that could be reached in time, I stated exactly what we meant to do, and the present 90 percent parity price in the farm program was sustained and supported completely.  Moreover, we pledge that these programs in the future, as it comes time for them to be revised and brought up to date as all programs must be, it will be farmers that will be brought in to Washington whose counsel and advice will not only be sought but, it will be heed."

Which makes it all the more necessary that we watch with a jaundiced eye anything that is unnecessary--all of the waste, the duplication, the inefficiency that we know about, and which you would not expect me here today at this time to enumerate.  That must be eliminated and it is the second purpose of this crusade."

They will be consulted, and not the way they are consulted now:  You do this or you will get no more.  They will be consulted on what is the problem of their locality.

America, which has lifted man to his highest economic state, which has saved freedom in war and peace, which saved collective security, no longer sparks and flames and gives off new ideas and initiatives.

But that is not the reason you ought to reelect him.  The reason you ought to reelect him is because he has served this state, and I don't know of a more difficult job in the United States than to be governor of an expanding atate with problems of education, taking care of our older people, the mentally retarded and all the rest.  I think Orville Freeman has moved forward with courage.  I am confident that this State is going to respond to that kind of leadership. "

I have the greatest confidence in the United States.  I am not satisfied to see it second best in any area of national and international life.  I want an America that is not first, if; not first, but; not first, when; but first, period, and I think we can do it.  I believe that this generation of Americans has the same rendezvous with destiny as that generation of Americans in 1936 to whom Franklin Roosevelt addressed those words, that that generation had a rendezvous with destiny.  I believe we do, too.  The rendezvous was the question of whether freedom could be maintained here in the United States.  Our destiny is to determine whether freedom can be maintained throughout the world, whether a house divided against itself can survive, whether a world can exist half slave and half free."

And--at the same foreign ministers' conference--the United States suffered one of its few diplomatic defeats in the history of inter-American relations, when it was forced to withdraw its protest over Communist efforts in this hemisphere. This is a critical situation--to find so dangerous an enemy on our very doorstep.  The American people want to know how this was permitted to happen--how the Iron Curtain could have advanced almost to our front yard.  They want to know the truth--and I believe that they are entitled to the truth.  It is not enough to blame it on unknown state department personnel.  Major policy on issues such as Cuban security is made at the highest levels--in the national Security Council and elsewhere--and it is the party in power which must accept full responsibility for this disaster."

Now, as the market price drops so drops the support price.  Where you had $1.50 for corn eight years ago, you may be getting 90 cents for corn today, or 93 cents.  That is the market price.

Our programs grow from what we think are people's needs--and I don't mean just a few people--I mean all of the people. And that means equality of opportunity for all, regardless of race and color or creed. Most of all today we stand for peace--not for another war to end all wars, but for peace without war. We are not making the promises that the Republicans are, and we don't play politics with promises we know we cannot keep. We are trying to talk straight to the American people. We are recognizing that the course ahead of us is a stern course; that there are no easy, cheap solutions for Communism, for want, for hunger, for all of the miseries that torment our world. But we believe with all of our hearts that if we make this nation strong we can keep good times at home and avoid that war that would destroy the world. "

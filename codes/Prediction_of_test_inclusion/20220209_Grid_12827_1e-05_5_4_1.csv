9.84144572176024e-05,0.999901585542783,1032_10,0,"Well, the world passed them by. Since then, we have been through a Great Depression, a great recovery and a devastating war. And somewhere in this process America has fundamentally changed--a new view, a new compassion, a new faith has emerged. In a way it is a moral revival, and it has altered the tone and the meaning of our life. And how different a prospect faces a young man or a young woman of today from what faced the youth of my generation. The only or, most of all, the go-getter was the hero. Few cared about politics or public service -almost none who went through school or college with me took any positive interest in that, or have subsequently. Few had the sense of civil or social responsibility that we find today, when they were young."

The great transformation which has overtaken our country in these twenty years has come about, in great part, because we have had a new spirit and a new purpose in our government--you could almost feel the change from confusion to confidence, from fear to faith, when the election of 1932 produced a great new leader, Franklin Roosevelt. And that was only the beginning of the process by which America began to lift itself out of the depths, both economically and spiritually, and onto a new plane of social responsibility and of decency. Government assumed responsibilities to avert economic catastrophe and to assure reasonable levels of security for the people. By doing this, great new energies within the people were unlocked. Of course, this new activity on the part of government aroused resentment. The Old Guard began raising their tired old refrain of socialism, and regimentation; you have heard these cries against every new idea in American history since the post office and the public schools."
9.90436331996223e-05,0.9999009563668,1040_8,0,"You know, they used to say in Washington in the early days of the war that you were likely to contract one of three diseases--either ulcers, galloping frustration, or a sense of humor. I have never felt better; I feel frustrated only by the difficulty I have had in engaging in any genuine debate with the Republicans; and, as far as my sense of humor is concerned, I hope it is intact. And I hope the time will never come when the Republican party gets into office and forbids any humor in political campaigns."
9.68284251473917e-05,0.999903171574853,1047_1,0,"There is some very important business before our nation, as you all know, and it encourages me to think that these many groups we see all the time have a strong feeling we had better leave the management of our affairs in the hands of the Democratic party. And one reason for this is that it has become harder and harder instead of easier and easier to tell precisely what the Republican party stands for in this campaign. I confess it is early in the morning to be harsh about anybody and to be very critical of anybody. I don't want to be critical or harsh. I have in mind that we are now only a week from our election and we still don't know precisely what the Republicans propose to do about much of anything. We know where they stand on the matter of a new labor relations law, for example. That is precisely where they stood for the past five years. That is an old Republican position."

Who gave us the Marshall Plan which prevented the Kremlin's bloodless conquest of Western Europe? Who faced up to the Russians in Berlin when they tried to strangle and seize that city? Who insisted on the heroic airlift and who was it that hammered out the North Atlantic Alliance, which banded together the free people of Europe in a united defense against Communist aggression?"

And we are going to continue to shout and do what we think is right to extend the gains that we have made here at home, and to fight for peace abroad. In the conduct of our foreign affairs we will suffer no tyranny over us, just as we will suffer no tyranny of one American over another.  We want to impose no tyranny on any other people.  We will remain free ourselves--more so.  We will find, as we have found before, the balance between the power we generate and the brakes that will check the power of those hostile to us.  In this way we can move in the wide open world as our fathers did when our nation was founded, and we can move unafraid.  I am reluctant to stop, although I have talked entirely too much, both here and all throughout this campaign.  All the same I have left much unsaid that is in my heart.  All I can do now is to thank all of you and, through you, thank all Americans for the privilege of your attention in these past months."

Here is something else we are going to cast out--governmental domination of the people it is supposed to serve.  When I talk about this you may get the idea that I am trying to be philosophical or highbrow, but believe me, this thing affects the lives of every one of us.  Like the rest of the things we will cast out, this too is a product of fear and lack of faith in the people.  This idea that government is the people's master is widespread in our world.  It is called by many names, but it always leads to the same destination.  It puts the gears of progress in reverse and carries society back to the days when the king was government and government was the final goal and the only power."

My convictions would require it.   The federal government did not create the states in this republic.  The states created the federal government.  The creation should not supersede the creator."
9.60016168154677e-05,0.999903998383184,1132_3,0,"The great question of our time is peace.  Are we going to have a kind of peace that will allow our nation to live tranquilly, prosperously, as it goes forward leading the free nations of the world, or is it going to live in fear, hysteria and doubt with our young men never knowing whether they are going to be home or going to be sent to a foreign shore, whether we are going to be calm and peaceful in our homes or whether we are going to live in this hateful fear.  I think the young men and women of today are really going to settle this question."
9.50845733592078e-05,0.999904915426641,1158_2,0,"I get up early in the morning and I talk all day long.  By evening my vocal chords are showing the strain and my disposition and everything else.  But then I think of you people who work not only on an intensive basis like that part of the time, but all the time, keeping the party together, keeping it financed, keeping it presented properly before all the people, and I realize what public service really means.  It is not just the limelight, although sometimes these lights are pretty bright, at that.  It is the day by day chore."
9.41160042314628e-05,0.999905883995769,1165_4,0,"Now, the government has stumbled and fumbled in failing to bring us closer to peace.  In the last seven years look what has happened to us.  We stopped the shooting war in 1945 the strongest military nation in the world, to say nothing of our academic strength and our spiritual, intellectual, scientific and moral strength.  We were the greatest military nation on the globe."

Now, in this crowd, ladies and gentlemen, there are numbers of men who are my old comrades in arms.  Some of them may have fought in the Far Pacific; some may have had duties that kept them in the U.S.; many of them went abroad with me.  And I used to see those fellows along the roads, in the camps, sometimes at reviews, in their barracks, in their kitchen, wherever; and we used to talk about why we were fighting.  And we came to the agreement in simple terms that we were fighting to keep America the kind of land that we believe it to be--a land of freedom and opportunity, not a land dominated by a Hitler or by any group of bureaucrats.  The reason I am in this political campaign, my friends, is in a continuation of that promise.  I am trying to do my part to keep America the kind of country we have always known, which means first of all that you must have a government you can respect and other nations will likewise respect it because you do.

9.0535922768576e-05,0.999909464077231,1174_9,0,"Can this burden be lightened without endangering national security? A Democrat administration--stale and self-satisfied from being too long in power complacently says: No, nothing can be done. That is not an American answer. Our answer is: Yes, much can be done."
0.13096632687827,0.86903367312173,1175_1,0,"Now it happens today is September 25th.  It is one of the significant days in our history that is not often celebrated.  It is the day that marked the adoption of the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution.  In that Bill of Rights it specifies what are the rights of human beings as opposed to the power of government, the limits of what government can do to the individual today, and those ten amendments, possibly coupled with the organization our forefathers gave us, is the real genius of American government.  When those rights, any one of them, comes in peril from within or any threat from without, it is time for every loyal American, not just the rich, not just the farmers, not just the workmen, but everybody.  It is time for every loyal American to rise up, take a look, gird himself for battle, and fight off the encroachment."
9.3200039101968e-05,0.999906799960898,1178_30,0,"But informed people know that the plant is being located here because a careful investigation by a great private industry discovered that the waters of the Savannah River were peculiarly suitable for certain processes essential to the development of atomic energy.  Of course, it's possible--though I doubt it--that the Savannah River, itself, has its source in a Washington Bureau. This, my friends, is a good year for some straight political thinking.  It is a bad year to be fooled.  It would be a particularly bad year to be fooled into thinking that the Washington mess is the fault of you, the people.  And we will not be fooled into the belief that this great land of ours and the progress we have achieved here are blessings handed down by government.  We are going to think straight--straight through to the conclusion that America is what free Americans--with courage and sweat and drive--have made it.  "
9.96222400486201e-05,0.999900377759952,1193_16,0,"At a critical moment in World War II, we induced the Nazis to hold an entire army in reserve in the Calais area to meet an attack that they thought was coming but which we never intended to launch.  Measures to deceive them worked so effectively that they estimated our original strength in Europe at seventy-five divisions instead of the actual thirty-six. In the entire American record in Europe there is no single instance where the enemy gained essential information of our plans through the medium of spies or subversive agents."
9.18315677550613e-05,0.999908168432245,1233_24,0,"The Republicans have not only participated in every one of our enlightened farm programs, protection of farmers against disasters where they can't protect themselves, but they have pledged this:  When it comes time in the future to begin to study these programs and how we adjust them to changing and future conditions, farmers will be brought in and farm leaders will be brought in.  They will be consulted, and not the way they are consulted now:  You do this or you will get no more.  They will be consulted on what is the problem of their locality.  We have no intention in this crusade of getting a bunch of long-haired Brannan experts to come out and run your farms.  We figure you can do it a little better."
9.58771042153298e-05,0.999904122895785,1280_3,0,"We have got to get dedicated men and women from all over this United States who have been living closer to the people, who have not grown arrogant by being too long in power, who have not gotten too complacent or indifferent or think they can sell any bill of goods of fear and despair to America and so secure its votes. Now, if we are going to have a fresh start on this thing, we have got to have a complete change in the political complexion in Washington.  I picked up this morning a little clipping.  I am going to read to you just two sentences:  In South Bend, Indiana, yesterday, someone from the crowd addressed by the Democratic candidate, the administration's hand-picked candidate, shouted this question, Would you fire Acheson?   And it says here, Dean Acheson, the Secretary of State, and the answer was this, I will answer questions like that after the election, the Governor replied.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is the only answer the poor man could make.  He has the record, this sorry record of the last seven years to defend, and here is one he can't defend; but he can't on the other hand, say in advance, I repudiate that record and the people who have made it.  But I say, this crusade in which I am engaged does repudiate that record of error, and we are ready to replace from top to bottom.  No one has anything but admiration for the great body of public servants of America who are contained in the civil service and in the uniformed services.  We are talking, in this top to bottom clean-out, about these political appointees, the policy-makers, if you please, of our country--and not only in domestic policy but in this foreign field."

9.4136154717221e-05,0.999905863845283,1309_5,0,"Then they began to fear that my associates and I would bring about a depression, that we would like suddenly to see the United States broke, go into an economic collapse.  But it happens that we have been the ones who are preaching that the greater fear and the threat of our time is Communism, and the only way to fight Communism is with a prosperous America--an America that is fully employed, with working men and women at good jobs with good pay, with farmers prosperous.  We preached that and taught it and carried it everywhere.  So they had to abandon that."

We are committed to the expansion and improvement of social security programs, particularly to saving what is left of our dollars so that your insurance policies, your old age insurance, your unemployment insurance and the rest of itdon't run out of your pocket through that big hole they call inflation.  Unless we stop that, there is no hope."

I said earlier this week at the American Legion Convention in Los Angeles that: There is not peace--the peace we seek--while our sons and brothers are still being drafted for two years of military service, their schooling interrupted, their normal lives postponed."
9.30187788977003e-05,0.999906981221103,1327_2,0,"Well, the American people won't be fooled. What matters is not what it says on the label, but what is inside the package. And inside the Republican package is the same old stuff, the same Old Guard, the same old promises they make every four years. They still shine--but then, why shouldn't they? They've never been used."

The Republican leadership cannot hope to meet the challenge of the future--because it can hardly bear to live in the present. The pace of change is quickening every moment, with every new discovery in our laboratories, every new invention in our workshops, every new upsurge of human ambition and hope in the revolutionary turbulence of the world. To meet the challenge of the twentieth century we need every resource of imagination, of intelligence, of courage, and of faith."
9.16009374063483e-05,0.999908399062594,1374_20,0,"The fact is that the Republicans, taking over the country at a high point of economic activity, have done nothing for such vital groups in the population as small businessmen and farmers--and have done less than nothing to prepare for the difficult problems of the future. The Eisenhower administration seems to have confused genuine friendship for business with snuggling intimacy toward a few of its giants.

Fourth, we must appoint a Federal Power Commission that represents the public interest and not the private interest. Therefore, in the 1960s we need a whole new concept of resource development. So vast, so complex, and so essential are our natural resources that they cannot be parceled out piecemeal; nothing less than a comprehensive, basin-by-basin, valley-by-valley development of our natural resources, to make sure that not one drop of our water goes from the wellsprings of our water to the sea without being used for a public purpose."

I think we need an administration which so regards it. We spend $42 billion on defense every year. Those ships sail the oceans. They protect us but they do not serve our people and the world. I do not regard the distribution of food around the world as a great burden upon us. I regard it as an opportunity, to use our assets in a way which will attract people to the cause of freedom. I am glad that this is our problem, and not starvation. I am glad we can produce more than we can consume, if we share it usefully, for we are our brother's keeper; and if we have great assets in this country, I believe we should hold out the hand of friendship. When hundreds of millions of people stagger through their lives searching for food and we have it, and we are trying to determine which way the world will go, I would rather see our food used in an imaginative way than to argue in kitchens or anyplace else.

Only ninety miles away stood the United States--their good neighbor--the richest nation on earth--its radios and newspapers and movies spreading the story of America's material wealth and surplus crops. But instead of holding out a helping hand of friendship to the desperate people of Cuba, nearly all our aid was in the form of weapons assistance--assistance which merely strengthened the Batista dictatorship--assistance which completely failed to advance the economic welfare of the Cuban people--assistance which enabled Castro and the Communists to encourage the growing belief that America was indifferent to Cuban aspirations for a decent life."

Mr. Nixon could not run on the program that he runs on if he recognized our times.  He could not run on the program that our power and prestige is at its height, that of the communists at the lowest it has been, that everything is all right and being done in its proper measure.  The very fact that he chooses that as his campaign indicates that he could not suddenly reverse in 1961 and determine on action.  If he really believes these things he says, in my opinion he disqualifies himself.  If he does not believe them, and runs on that program, he makes the same mistake that Stanley Baldwin made in England in 1935 which almost destroyed Great Britain, by misleading the people of England in 1935.  He prevented them, by not telling them the truth, he prevented them from arming at a time when it might have been possible to prevent the disaster of Munich."

To that end, I have proposed a national program in support of education, emphasizing such elements as college scholarships for those who cannot under any circumstances afford to borrow and to pay back, tax credits or deductions to cover tuition and other costs of higher education, aid in school construction to provide needed facilities, and thereby to release local funds for raising teachers' salaries--all of this, however, particularly at the secondary and primary level, to be accomplished without compromising local controls of our school system."

I suggest he is silent because he has no answers to the problems his policies have created. By contrast, a Reagan-Bush administration will be able to reverse the decline in Americans' standard of living, and we will begin working to do this our first day in office. Last month, I offered a comprehensive economic program geared at reducing the growth in federal spending, in taxes, in regulation, and in the money supply, and restoring predictability and stability to economic policy. These are steps this administration has utterly refused to take, but they will form the foundation of the Reagan-Bush economic plan. And when we carry out these steps, we will be able to gradually reduce inflation and unemployment at the same time. That way, we can restore the dream to Americans of a continually improving standard of living."

The average teacher in America today starts at about $14,000 or $13,000 a year.  In some states it's far less.  I was in Florida a year ago, and I saw a teacher's schedule that showed a teacher who had twenty years of teaching with a doctorate degree made $17,000 a year.  I may be off a couple thousand, but I remember being shocked by the figure.  I have talked to any number of young people who went into teaching full of hope and found out they just couldn't stick with it, couldn't afford it.  I talked to a young man in New Hampshire.  I don't think he voted for me based on the returns, but we had a nice conversation.  He told me that, more than anything, he wanted to be a science teacher.  But he had a family of two kids, he was now thirty-six years of age.  He said, I couldn't do it.  I had to get out.  And I made double or triple whatever it was in the private sector.  What is happening today is that a lot of young, skilled people are not going into education.  The tests show that a disproportionate number are testing at the lowest levels of skills and aptitudes.  That doesn't mean a lot of them won't become good teachers.  We ought to have a society in which both in terms of the environment of teaching being honored as a profession and the pay, is such that the very best, the top of each class, goes into education.  I think last year--as I recall, in Los Angeles--I believe I was told that a beginning teacher there made $13,000 and a beginning policeman $28,000.  I don't begrudge the policeman's salary at all.  But we're saying something about teaching when we give it this low status, and, of course, our kids will pay and our nation will pay.  By now we should know that it is the product of the trained mind that is the greatest source of wealth in America.  It's more important than all of our national resources, everything.  That's from an economic standpoint.  But education, of course--that's why I use the word learning--goes to the basis of our democracy, to our personal enrichment and fulfillment, of our understanding of this ever more dangerous world in which we live.  Education does everything that we need.  And it all begins with what goes on in that classroom.  If it's not effective, if we don't have the best teaching, it's not going to work.  As president, I intend to put a tremendous amount of attention on this.  I've spent a lot of my life in it.  And I don't think there's any other way of getting it done except with presidential leadership."

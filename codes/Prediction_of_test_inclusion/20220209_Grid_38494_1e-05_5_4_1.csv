In all events, I am very grateful to all of you for being here this afternoon. I have just had a most interesting experience. I was presented on the rear platform of the train with an enormous placard--here it is--they are all of the Ike buttons, gathered by the Volunteers for Stevenson from people who have switched."
8.8996868489348e-05,0.999911003131511,1037_2,0,"Now, you know, I wouldn't say, my friends, that this proves conclusively that the Old Guard Republicans are really Communists, but I suppose if I were an Old Guard Republican I would, because that is exactly the way they argue. The great transformation which has overtaken our country in these twenty years has come about, in great part, because we have had a new spirit and a new purpose in our government--you could almost feel the change from confusion to confidence, from fear to faith, when the election of 1932 produced a great new leader, Franklin Roosevelt. And that was only the beginning of the process by which America began to lift itself out of the depths, both economically and spiritually, and onto a new plane of social responsibility and of decency. Government assumed responsibilities to avert economic catastrophe and to assure reasonable levels of security for the people. By doing this, great new energies within the people were unlocked. Of course, this new activity on the part of government aroused resentment. The Old Guard began raising their tired old refrain of socialism, and regimentation; you have heard these cries against every new idea in American history since the post office and the public schools."
8.42288867912777e-05,0.999915771113209,1047_1,0,"There is some very important business before our nation, as you all know, and it encourages me to think that these many groups we see all the time have a strong feeling we had better leave the management of our affairs in the hands of the Democratic party. And one reason for this is that it has become harder and harder instead of easier and easier to tell precisely what the Republican party stands for in this campaign. I confess it is early in the morning to be harsh about anybody and to be very critical of anybody. I don't want to be critical or harsh. I have in mind that we are now only a week from our election and we still don't know precisely what the Republicans propose to do about much of anything. We know where they stand on the matter of a new labor relations law, for example. That is precisely where they stood for the past five years. That is an old Republican position."
8.75717808811528e-05,0.999912428219119,1054_5,0,"I think, regardless of political considerations, that it is essential that if we are going to win in the long term this conflict with Communists--this conflict with a society that seeks to spread itself over the entire globe--that we must recognize that until we find the means--and until we find cooperation in the means of restoring a sense of well-being to peoples who know little of freedom in the terms that we understand it, that we will have a very threatening and a hostile enemy. That is why one can believe that the importance of bolstering our defenses by the foreign aid programs--Point Four, and things of that kind--are essential if we are going to hope to frustrate the designs of this godless tyranny throughout the world. I thank you so much for affording me this opportunity of participating even briefly in the ceremonies. I count you very fortunate indeed to have this splendid housing development in your neighborhood; and I can add that I am very jealous of it. I should like to be participating in a similar project in Chicago where we too have desperate need of the advantages of public housing."
9.72533517194667e-05,0.99990274664828,1069_9,0,"We also have my sister Mrs. Ernest Ives. And now I should like to present to you a famous Pennsylvanian, a beloved and honored lady of this state, Mrs. Emma Guffey Miller. Have we got any more beauties to present?"
8.16410344588886e-05,0.999918358965541,1074_2,0,"Then--then the people will vote on Tuesday. I understand that on Wednesday the newspapers plan to publish a Five-Star Final. Many thousands of our votes will come from rank-and-file Republicans who will vote with us. No doubt some Democrats will vote for the Republican candidates. We have already, for example, traded a couple of southern governors for the senator from Oregon and the vice chairman of the National Young Republicans. And I regard this as a profitable exchange for us. I would be happy to throw in a second baseman--but not Jackie Robinson."
8.6419053779245e-05,0.999913580946221,1132_3,0,"The great question of our time is peace.  Are we going to have a kind of peace that will allow our nation to live tranquilly, prosperously, as it goes forward leading the free nations of the world, or is it going to live in fear, hysteria and doubt with our young men never knowing whether they are going to be home or going to be sent to a foreign shore, whether we are going to be calm and peaceful in our homes or whether we are going to live in this hateful fear.  I think the young men and women of today are really going to settle this question."
8.07458077913326e-05,0.999919254192209,1165_4,0,"Now, the government has stumbled and fumbled in failing to bring us closer to peace.  In the last seven years look what has happened to us.  We stopped the shooting war in 1945 the strongest military nation in the world, to say nothing of our academic strength and our spiritual, intellectual, scientific and moral strength.  We were the greatest military nation on the globe."
8.42771328586362e-05,0.999915722867142,1174_32,0,"The program I have outlined demands skilled and purposeful leadership. It demands harmony and understanding between the executive and legislative branches of our government. It will demand an end to what the Senate Preparedness Subcommittee has called abuse, misuse and disuse of power."
9.12346727945342e-05,0.999908765327205,1183_0,0,"Ladies and gentlemen: there is not much relationship between the military life that I led for forty-one years and the kind of campaigning that I am now doing, but every once in a while I am reminded of certain rules or maxims in habits from that life, and one of them was, Never allow yourself to be surprised.  I was told that the last stop at Grand Rapids, Now, this is where you say goodbye to Michigan.  And then as we came along, a couple of your finest salesmen from Kalamazoo said, We are going to slow up the train as you go through Kalamazoo and you wave at some people.  Then later they said, Now, we'll tell you what we want to do.  We'll stop there a second and you just go on out and say hello and go on with your work.  I'll tell you this; it's a funny kind of a slowing down and a funny kind of a way to a little neighborhood crowd.  I am completely flabbergasted and I am certainly honored."
9.84755230437902e-05,0.999901524476956,1187_0,0,"Good afternoon, folks.  You know, folks, it strikes me that Senator Dirksen must indeed be a very powerful Senator when he can arrange by remote control such weather for this meeting.  I pay my compliments to him.  To each of you I extend my very warm thanks for coming here this afternoon, for giving me a chance to greet you, to say hello, and to express to you one or two thoughts that I have in mind as we progress in this political campaign."
8.88149312411179e-05,0.999911185068759,1197_18,0,"As you know, the collector of internal revenue in one of our great districts is a high federal official.  Nine of them have been relieved for malfeasance or for cheating, or for something else wrong.  Some are behind bars--not long enough--but they are there because they lined their pockets with your money.  That has got to stop.  That is one thing that you don't have to stand for. "
9.06088179643775e-05,0.999909391182035,1213_8,0,"If we do that, ladies and gentlemen, then we are a truly religious civilization, marching forward under a firm leadership, a united leadership that is bound to bring us, first, peace in the world, greater prosperity at home, with that kind of distribution of that prosperity that allows every single loyal American of good will to work for the betterment of himself, his family, his community and America. I don't come before you, ladies and gentlemen, to make any long list of promises.  All the promises, the political promises, have been used up in the last 20 years anyway.  What I bring to you is a pledge, a pledge couched in the kind of thing that you people have a right to demand and expect of your government, that if you want to send the leaders of this crusade to Washington; they make this pledge now, they will above all things be honest; they will make it possible for all the agencies of the government that have the task of investigating--to make it possible for them to make their findings open to the public.  There will be no concealing of crookedness and dirt in the new administration."
8.45494505660065e-05,0.999915450549434,1226_0,0,"My first and most pleasant duty, of course, is to thank you for coming out here today.  You give me a chance to look in your faces, to bring you a word of greeting, and to give you one or two of the thoughts that are on my mind as we go through this political campaign.  I have had a wonderful day and a half in your state, starting up at Sacramento.  It seems to me I have been covering ground very rapidly and every place there seems to be a new surprise.  Now, for example, here when the so-called professional politicians began to give me my lessons in this new art a few months back, they told me there was one thing you could not do-go to an airport and address a group of American citizens.  I was told they simply wouldn't come.  So I find out today that at least in Long Beach those political friends of mine were wrong, and I am delighted."
9.28721381808901e-05,0.999907127861819,1269_10,0,"Last Thursday night, it was my honor to address the dinner annually held in New York in memory of that great American leader, Alfred E. Smith.  I spoke of the undying hate of Communism for our American way of life.  There is no question that we are marked as Communism's final and greatest victim to be."
8.95550811505799e-05,0.99991044491885,1269_21,0,"A strong America, a well-governed America, an America that is morally and spiritually sound, is the best answer to the evil threat of cynicism and lack of self-respect within, and to the evil threat of Communism without.  If you believe that as I do, will you join our crusade? This crusade which I have taken to the American people represents what I, myself, believe.  I have acted and I have spoken from my own deep inner convictions of what is best and right for America.  I have been steadfast to my convictions.  I have made no deals.  I am still a no deal man.  And let me tell you just this:  I have lived sixty-two years and one week and I have never been anyone's captive yet.  And never will be!"
8.58162052547678e-05,0.999914183794745,1270_17,0,"We must call upon the best minds of our nations to sit down with political and economic leaders of other nations to find solutions to the crucial problems of international economic policy.  I believe that the wrecking of the London Economic Conference of 1933 was one of the great, though little understood, tragedies of our modern world.  We must make a fresh start."
0.00027531258278037,0.99972468741722,1293_2,0,"I am exceedingly proud, my friends, to address you in a hall that is a war memorial, dedicated to our veterans. I hear that more than twenty-thousand people contributed their funds to make this hall possible.  Whenever anything comes to my attention that involves veterans, I, like most other old soldiers, want to reminisce a bit.  Never do I get tired of reminiscing about the heroism, the sacrifices, the devotion to our country of the millions of men and women who made up our fighting forces in World War II.  I am really proud that the city of Johnstown has chosen to take a building such as this that will be used by your citizenry through the years to make it a lasting useful memorial to their services."
8.72794086826903e-05,0.999912720591317,1303_4,0,"The essential difference between this worn-out bureaucracy in Washington and the crusade is this:  They want to sit in Washington and direct your lives and your businesses and check up on you from thousands or hundreds of miles away.  We want to see you develop yourselves with every single thing you have got in you and hold the government ready to help you whenever it is necessary, but to work with you and not just to work you. We believe that if we bring to Washington the outstanding men and women of this crusade--your representatives, people coming right out of this crowd, men who have been introduced to you from this platform--that all of those people will be your guarantee that there is no crookedness in government, that subversion and Communism isn't getting inside of government.  They will be your guarantee that if a stray individual does go bad and betrays his trust, that kind of thing will be ripped out of government without delay."
7.96604368169298e-05,0.999920339563183,1304_4,0,"Just one or two items that are in this program of fear, and I will be on my hasty way through this section of New York state. They fear, they say, that these Republican, Independent and enlightened Democratic friends of mine will bring on a depression; that we may be able to lead the country toward peace, but if we do, there will be no jobs, men will be out of work, there will be breadlines--all that sort of bunk.  Now, the first thing that is necessary to lead our country toward peace is a strong America; and the first thing that means a strong America is an employed America--a prosperous America--that stands as an example of what free government can do for its citizens in this world.  That is the purpose to which this crusade is dedicated."
0.998930855559497,0.00106914444050355,1307_8,1,"I am very proud also that I had wonderful friends who jumped into the breach to defend me against this charge.  I didn't have to do it myself.  Rabbi Silver and Bernie Baruch and Cardinal Spellman took care of that one, and Judge Reynolds and a few others took care of it.  I more than ever pledged myself to see that we remove the remaining stains of discrimination from our national life.  We can do that if it isn't made a partisan issue, but we must have the aid of men from both parties--if they are men of good will and that is what I intend to do--and what I say I will do I will do."
8.63674814453532e-05,0.999913632518555,1314_11,0,Tied to that problem is this one of Civil Service.  You put Ike and his friends in the administration and they will fire civil servants by the scores.  That is just bunk.  I have lived with those people a whole lot longer than some of the people who are now criticizing me and I like and admire them.
8.02637756041016e-05,0.999919736224396,1318_14,0,"Don't misunderstand me. I, for one, am ready to acknowledge the sincerity of the Republican President's desire for peace and happiness for all. But good intentions are not good enough and the country is stalled on dead center--stalled in the middle of the road--while the world goes whirling by. America, which has lifted man to his highest economic state, which has saved freedom in war and peace, which saved collective security, no longer sparks and flames and gives off new ideas and initiatives. Our lights are dimmed. We chat complacently of this and that while, in Carlyle's phrase, Death and eternity sit glaring. And I could add that opportunity, neglected opportunity, sits glaring too!"
8.60680900019424e-05,0.999913931909998,1367_28,0,"What the Old Guard Republican leaders did to get their man in was to decide, coldly and with due calculation, that the personal popularity of one man was great enough that the general distrust of another wouldn't matter. They concluded, or rather they hoped, that enough voters would cast a ballot for one man's popularity without regard to the possible consequences if another became President. I think they were wrong. I think the people of this country do not view the vice presidency-- at least in these times-- as a casual incident. They know what the vice presidency is this nation's life insurance policy. They are going to read the fine print. And I don't think they are going to go for four years uninsured."
8.34213083029172e-05,0.999916578691697,1374_20,0,"The fact is that the Republicans, taking over the country at a high point of economic activity, have done nothing for such vital groups in the population as small businessmen and farmers--and have done less than nothing to prepare for the difficult problems of the future. The Eisenhower administration seems to have confused genuine friendship for business with snuggling intimacy toward a few of its giants. And meanwhile the big have gotten bigger and the small are disappearing."
8.77138589976888e-05,0.999912286141003,1378_35,0,What does Mr. Eisenhower propose then? That we go ahead with the development of the cobalt bomb to try to gain another advantage? A force that can shake the earth's axis.
9.12188836197855e-05,0.99990878111638,1384_8,0,It's a wonderful technique these Republicans have. A measure passes in spite of this opposition. And then President Eisenhower claims it as a Republican accomplishment. You might call this the politics of adoption. Or you might call it just plain deceit.
8.52484879014158e-05,0.999914751512099,1389_20,0,"The Republican party has no program to offer America, no policy, no philosophy. In fact, it seems to have little else but President Eisenhower--who in the next years would inevitably recede more and more from the picture. The fact is that the Republican administration has taken everything from the Democratic past--and offers nothing to the American future."

We live in a time of revolutionary change. Before our eyes, in the very headlines of our daily papers, a new world is being born."
8.55064114686178e-05,0.999914493588531,1398_34,0,"We cannot prove wise and strong by any such simple device as suspending, unilaterally, our H-bomb tests. Our atomic knowledge and power have forged the saving shield of freedom. And the future use and control of atomic power can be assured, not by any theatrical national gesture, but only by explicit and supervised international agreements."
9.69977285696053e-05,0.99990300227143,1401_11,0,"That line of thinking suggests that old story of Abe Lincoln's about a fence and a pig. The fence was so crooked that every time the pig went through it, he came out the same side he went in. Lately, it seems some people have gone the pig one better. On price supports, they've come out on both sides of the fence."
8.25152955385842e-05,0.999917484704461,1401_35,0,"Where there was doubt, there is confidence. My friends, I believe that these facts plainly mark the path of our nation's progress. If you also believe this--if you want to keep on this way--then each of you must do your part to the full in making your decision clear and emphatic."
8.67759168925528e-05,0.999913224083108,1417_22,0,"All of these have meant some worthy effort to promote that understanding, that common reverence of the spirit of justice that will finally bring to the peoples of the earth a peace in which we can confidently trust. But are these wailing politicians really trying to bring Americans to believe that our nation's voice is not urging--daily and powerfully--conciliation, mutual understanding and justice? We are doing exactly that in the Suez problem."
9.26532067818499e-05,0.999907346793218,1417_24,0,"Yet in our labor toward the peace we seek, we must comprehend always its basic requirements and face up to them manfully. First: strength--spiritual, intellectual, economic and military strength. Second: unity--our clear awareness that the road to peace is one that all nations must travel together, else neither can do so. Third: faith--a faith in the greatness of our purpose that inspires in all of us a readiness to work and to sacrifice that this greatest of all mankind's hopes may one day be realized."
9.0011844164956e-05,0.999909988155835,1425_5,0,"Now, in the work for peace, again, each of us has a job to do--to make certain that our nation stays strong, that we live in the faith of our fathers, that peace can finally be achieved for the world, that we can do our part in right thinking, in working at our daily jobs to convince others in the world that we want none of their property, we don't want to dominate them, we merely want the opportunity for all men who love freedom to have it, to hold it, and to enjoy it. This is our task, not only for those who are in the Congress and in the state gubernatorial chairs and in the legislatures. All of us--America--must stand together, stand strong and be of one mind if we are, from our position of strength, going to lead really on the road of peace."

But I trust that no one in this vast assemblage will agree with those sentiments. For the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won--and we stand today on the edge of a new frontier--the frontier of the 1960s--a frontier of unknown opportunities and perils--a frontier of unfulfilled hopes and threats."

Fourth, we must appoint a Federal Power Commission that represents the public interest and not the private interest. Therefore, in the 1960s we need a whole new concept of resource development. So vast, so complex, and so essential are our natural resources that they cannot be parceled out piecemeal; nothing less than a comprehensive, basin-by-basin, valley-by-valley development of our natural resources, to make sure that not one drop of our water goes from the wellsprings of our water to the sea without being used for a public purpose."
8.49353571251331e-05,0.999915064642875,1477_4,0,"I was impressed by what Sam Rayburn said. I don't think there is any man in this century who has written more significant legislation of benefit to the people than Speaker Rayburn. He does it. He secures the support of the members of the House of Representatives from all states of the Union. He secures the undeviating loyalty of the majority leader from Massachusetts, John McCormack, his strong right arm, because they know that he speaks not only for Bonham, Texas; he speaks for the United States. And Lyndon Johnson, unanimously chosen on three different occasions by every senator of the United States in the Democratic Party to be the majority leader, was chosen because he was not only a senator from Texas, but a senator of the United States."

Mr. Nixon said later this week that that statement was false.  He boasts of tremendous power development during the past eight years, and he asserted that the Russians can overtake us only if we did nothing for fifteen years, while they built eight Grand Coulee Dams a year.  That is his charge and what are the facts?  The facts were reported last year by a committee of the U.S. Senate, over which Mr. Nixon occasionally presides.  That committee's findings, and I quote, were Although the United States is still far ahead, the Russians could overtake us in 1975, in fifteen years, unless we speed up or they slow down.  Both countries will have, the Senate said, an equal power generating capacity which will be 337,500,000 kilowatts in 1975."

I have the greatest confidence in the United States.  I am not satisfied to see it second best in any area of national and international life.  I want an America that is not first, if; not first, but; not first, when; but first, period, and I think we can do it.  I believe that this generation of Americans has the same rendezvous with destiny as that generation of Americans in 1936 to whom Franklin Roosevelt addressed those words, that that generation had a rendezvous with destiny.  I believe we do, too.  The rendezvous was the question of whether freedom could be maintained here in the United States.  Our destiny is to determine whether freedom can be maintained throughout the world, whether a house divided against itself can survive, whether a world can exist half slave and half free."

I ask you to join me in a journey across the new frontiers of the 1960s.  I run for the office of the presidency not promising the things I am going to do for the country, but asking you to join with me in serving our country, in making it greater, in making it stronger, in making it fulfill its manifest destiny.

I ask you to join us in moving ahead.  I ask you to put your confidence in our party and in our leadership, a leadership which in this century has produced Mr. Truman and Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Wilson.  I do not ask you to put your confidence in a leadership in this century which has produced Mr. McKinley and Coolidge and Harding and Hoover and Landon and Dewey and now in 1960, Mr. Nixon.

Now, as the market price drops so drops the support price.  Where you had $1.50 for corn eight years ago, you may be getting 90 cents for corn today, or 93 cents.  That is the market price.  Mr. Nixon will pay you 90 percent of that market price next year, and if it drops to 85 cents, he will pay you 90 percent of that, and that is the step, down, down, down, until farmers are driven off their farms in increasing numbers."

There are 15 million American homes, according to the last Bureau of the Census, which are substandard.  Mr. Nixon has issued a paper on housing, and this, I think, is most revealing of all and one of the most endearing qualities of the Vice President.  In his position paper issued in New York within the last three weeks, he says that the Housing Act of 1949 has worked very well, and do you know as a congressman he voted against it?  In that position paper he called for greater emphasis on middle-income housing and he voted against that in 1950.  He calls for a greater flow of housing credit so that the American people can buy houses at low rates of interest.  But he neglects to mention his vote as vice president to increase the interest rates on the GI housing bans.  High interest rates never built a single home and one of the reasons why we are building 200,000 less homes each year than we should to keep up with our population increase is because of the high interest rate policy of this administration.

I think part of it is the difference between the two parties--the party of Harding, Hoover, Nixon, and Ford on the one hand; and the party of Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy and Johnson and Carter on the other hand. Part of it is the party; part of it, too, is the attitude of the leaders. I believe it is time now for us to restore what we have lost. I'm part of the South, and as I have said many times, in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas, and Tennessee, the best thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act. The granting to the black people of an equal opportunity. It not only liberated the blacks, but it also liberated the whites of our region. But now we still have the quiet, not so highly publicized discrimination, against the poor, against the average working American family who have lost their jobs, who are robbed by inflation, who have an insensitive government, who see their rights not protected any further.",2382_1,0.9996674896139092,0.99976221649388,0.000528871558471242,5.0121995064294204e-05,9.22868711508522e-05,0.9970793829293131

I ask you if we want four more years of that kind of presidential leadership.  Now the truth is that the old people who have had to struggle for every dollar that we have added to the retirement benefits--to do that over the opposition of this administration--the farmers who have had to fight for every dollar that they earn with their labor and their investment against the callousness of this big business, special interest administration--the housewife trying to grapple with the mounting grocery prices that confront us everyday--I say that none of these people can afford another four more years of the Nixon-Agnew policies and the time has come to elect new leadership in this country. And looking out on this crowd, many of whom are young people and some of whom have doubtless fought in Vietnam, others who may yet be called, considering the tragic costs of this long and seemingly endless war and remembering that President Nixon was the man who told us when he was seeking our votes just shortly before the 1968 election that those who cannot bring peace in four years don't deserve another chance, I ask you to join with me in doing what this slogan up here calls upon us to do: to bring America home from this killing and destruction and dying that has gone on for too long a time in Southeast Asia.

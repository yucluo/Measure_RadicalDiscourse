But I still don't feel that I am wasting my time by coming out here, and I am very grateful to all of you for being here, and to all of these children. I hope you are not cutting school."

I ask you: to whom should our people entrust the fight against Communism--to those Old Guard Republicans who, on one issue after another, vote the way our enemies like to see them vote? Or to those who have rallied the free world against Communist aggression?"

In all events, I am very grateful to all of you for being here this afternoon. I have just had a most interesting experience. I was presented on the rear platform of the train with an enormous placard--here it is--they are all of the Ike buttons, gathered by the Volunteers for Stevenson from people who have switched."

They are awful keen about this law enforcement, but they continue to use all these devices in their own posts. So it is a little incongruous. They say, By gosh, we are going to clean up crime in this community and get those slot machines out of that corner saloon. But of course, as far as our Legion Post, or VFW, or whatever it is, that belongs to us and it is certainly a different situation. And after all, the device is set to give the fellow at least a sixty to a hundred chance of winning as against one chance in a hundred in the commercial device; and, after all, we own the machine, and it is not owned by a syndicate of operators and placed on a rental basis. And so on and so on."

Such a war is unthinkable and would destroy the very people and the civilization that we seek to save. Yet the day of liberation will come, and there is much we can do in the meantime to help the unhappy people of Eastern Europe. Through the United Nations much is being done to rally the conscience of mankind. We can offer help and encouragement to those thousands of families and those individuals who are escaping, month by month, through the chinks in the Iron Curtain."

There is a provincial assumption--and fortunately not very widespread--that any man in public life in the South is bound to be a reactionary, or worse. If anyone can dispel this illusion, once and for all, John Sparkman is the man to do it."

Many thousands of our votes will come from rank-and-file Republicans who will vote with us. No doubt some Democrats will vote for the Republican candidates. We have already, for example, traded a couple of southern governors for the senator from Oregon and the vice chairman of the National Young Republicans. And I regard this as a profitable exchange for us. I would be happy to throw in a second baseman--but not Jackie Robinson."

And we are going to continue to shout and do what we think is right to extend the gains that we have made here at home, and to fight for peace abroad. In the conduct of our foreign affairs we will suffer no tyranny over us, just as we will suffer no tyranny of one American over another.  We want to impose no tyranny on any other people.  We will remain free ourselves--more so.  We will find, as we have found before, the balance between the power we generate and the brakes that will check the power of those hostile to us.  In this way we can move in the wide open world as our fathers did when our nation was founded, and we can move unafraid.  I am reluctant to stop, although I have talked entirely too much, both here and all throughout this campaign.  All the same I have left much unsaid that is in my heart.  All I can do now is to thank all of you and, through you, thank all Americans for the privilege of your attention in these past months."

I am down here for one purpose--to help get rid of the administration in Washington, an administration that has been living on emergencies and crises, emergencies that it manufactures. It likes the emergencies because out of them it makes the rugs, and a rug is a handy thing under which to sweep the evidence of your own errors and mistakes. That is what we have been doing with emergencies."

In those days, war traveled no faster than a horse's jog.  I ended my last tour with troops in May of this year.  By then, the pace of war had stepped up to the speed of the jet plane and the impact of the atomic bomb."

Are we going to have a kind of peace that will allow our nation to live tranquilly, prosperously, as it goes forward leading the free nations of the world, or is it going to live in fear, hysteria and doubt with our young men never knowing whether they are going to be home or going to be sent to a foreign shore, whether we are going to be calm and peaceful in our homes or whether we are going to live in this hateful fear.  I think the young men and women of today are really going to settle this question."

It makes certain that every time you come back you think more of this country.  If there is any veteran in this whole crowd who didn't have that same feeling when he came stemming into New York or San Francisco or Seattle or Norfolk, then I would be astonished because I have never yet met one who has not said, Well, one good thing a tour abroad does for you; it makes you understand how well worthwhile it is working here at home."

But then I think of you people who work not only on an intensive basis like that part of the time, but all the time, keeping the party together, keeping it financed, keeping it presented properly before all the people, and I realize what public service really means.  It is not just the limelight, although sometimes these lights are pretty bright, at that.  It is the day by day chore."

Now, in this crowd, ladies and gentlemen, there are numbers of men who are my old comrades in arms.  Some of them may have fought in the Far Pacific; some may have had duties that kept them in the U.S.; many of them went abroad with me.  And I used to see those fellows along the roads, in the camps, sometimes at reviews, in their barracks, in their kitchen, wherever; and we used to talk about why we were fighting.  And we came to the agreement in simple terms that we were fighting to keep America the kind of land that we believe it to be--a land of freedom and opportunity, not a land dominated by a Hitler or by any group of bureaucrats.  The reason I am in this political campaign, my friends, is in a continuation of that promise.  I am trying to do my part to keep America the kind of country we have always known, which means first of all that you must have a government you can respect and other nations will likewise respect it because you do.

I am glad to have been here to pay tribute to its progress and its record in that field. Now friends, thank you again for turning out.  Let me bring out the better half of the Eisenhower tribe."

Well, some things are so false you don't know the right words to use, at least in polite society, for condemning them.  I went to Kasson and on behalf of Republican leaders, and with the concurrence of the great men of the party, at least all that could be reached in time, I stated exactly what we meant to do, and the present 90 percent parity price in the farm program was sustained and supported completely.  Moreover, we pledge that these programs in the future, as it comes time for them to be revised and brought up to date as all programs must be, it will be farmers that will be brought in to Washington whose counsel and advice will not only be sought but, it will be heed."

Nine of them have been relieved for malfeasance or for cheating, or for something else wrong.  Some are behind bars--not long enough--but they are there because they lined their pockets with your money.  That has got to stop.  That is one thing that you don't have to stand for. "

Those Americans, of course, are largely our new babies born.  When each baby is born today it gets a very extraordinary present as it arrives into this world:  it gets its share of the national debt; it owes $1,750 for the privilege of having been born."

We will do them ladies and gentlemen only if we are a united people, united behind the great aspirations and purposes of our government.  And right there is the crux of the matter.  You must have a government that you trust, respect and believe in, if you are going to have a united United States.  A united United States would be a strong bulwark of peace.  A united strong United States can lead the free nations of the world into that kind of collective security program that will lift a great burden from our hearts:  the burden of fear abroad."

You give me a chance to look in your faces, to bring you a word of greeting, and to give you one or two of the thoughts that are on my mind as we go through this political campaign.  I have had a wonderful day and a half in your state, starting up at Sacramento.  It seems to me I have been covering ground very rapidly and every place there seems to be a new surprise.  Now, for example, here when the so-called professional politicians began to give me my lessons in this new art a few months back, they told me there was one thing you could not do-go to an airport and address a group of American citizens.  I was told they simply wouldn't come.  So I find out today that at least in Long Beach those political friends of mine were wrong, and I am delighted."

The first thing I find is a wash-rag and it says, Clean up with Ike. I have got, of course, many, many reasons for being pleased when I get out into this country.  Ever since 1919, friends of mine have been asking me out to fish and hunt, and it has been a grand country, but of course, I don't much chance, so I spend a great deal of time reading western stories.  One of the first ones I ever read was written right around here in this country.  I think it was written in Medicine Bow, Owen Wister's The Virginian."

I spoke of the undying hate of Communism for our American way of life.  There is no question that we are marked as Communism's final and greatest victim to be."

Second, by skillful, aggressive, and ruthless prosecution of the Cold War, the Soviet Empire has added to its already great resources the important industrial complex of Central and Eastern Europe, and has added to its own large population six-hundred million human beings for use either as slave labor, or as expendable military masses."

Rabbi Silver and Bernie Baruch and Cardinal Spellman took care of that one, and Judge Reynolds and a few others took care of it.  I more than ever pledged myself to see that we remove the remaining stains of discrimination from our national life.  We can do that if it isn't made a partisan issue, but we must have the aid of men from both parties--if they are men of good will and that is what I intend to do--and what I say I will do I will do."

You put Ike and his friends in the administration and they will fire civil servants by the scores.  That is just bunk.  I have lived with those people a whole lot longer than some of the people who are now criticizing me and I like and admire them.

But good intentions are not good enough and the country is stalled on dead center--stalled in the middle of the road--while the world goes whirling by. America, which has lifted man to his highest economic state, which has saved freedom in war and peace, which saved collective security, no longer sparks and flames and gives off new ideas and initiatives. Our lights are dimmed. We chat complacently of this and that while, in Carlyle's phrase, Death and eternity sit glaring. And I could add that opportunity, neglected opportunity, sits glaring too!"

I said earlier this week at the American Legion Convention in Los Angeles that: There is not peace--the peace we seek--while our sons and brothers are still being drafted for two years of military service, their schooling interrupted, their normal lives postponed."

The projects that have been built are monuments to the hard and persistent work of your representatives in Congress, of men like John McClellan and Bill Fulbright and the members of your House delegation. But they have succeeded only when the climate was right--that is, when your senators and congressmen had the sympathetic support of a Democratic administration instead of determined Republican opposition."

I remind him that his Secretary of Defense talked about workers out of jobs as kennel or hunting dogs, and that it was a White House assistant who said of unemployment this spring that the right to suffer is one of the joys of a free economy. And I want to say something, too, about another kind of indifference. I mean about the crisis in education in this country. The President said last night that twice in his State of the Union messages--in 1955 and 1956--he urged swift action--and that he even called a conference on education."

First of all, we must rededicate ourselves to our faith in democracy and make that faith a living principle. In the Middle East, Israel is a beacon of democratic faith and of twentieth century progress. Our policy, therefore, should be founded on the firm cornerstone of the friendship of the American people for its democratic friend--Israel. For three years we have tried the ignoble, expedient policy of isolating Israel and trying to buy the friendship of dictators. Colonel Nasser has given us his answer. Appeasement has once again proved neither wise nor honorable nor expedient."

Now, national health, the proper education of our children, and the human welfare of all Americans are discussed at the same table--and with the same exhaustive care--as such great subjects as foreign affairs and national security. The men of the opposition know perfectly well that one of the main reasons they were thrown out of office four years ago was their tolerance of the thievery of inflation. Just in the final seven years of their tenure of office, this economic fever had cut the value of the dollar by almost one-third, damaging the livelihood of the aged--the pensioned--all salaried workers.

This is our task, not only for those who are in the Congress and in the state gubernatorial chairs and in the legislatures.

I don't think there is any man in this century who has written more significant legislation of benefit to the people than Speaker Rayburn. He does it. He secures the support of the members of the House of Representatives from all states of the Union. He secures the undeviating loyalty of the majority leader from Massachusetts, John McCormack, his strong right arm, because they know that he speaks not only for Bonham, Texas; he speaks for the United States. And Lyndon Johnson, unanimously chosen on three different occasions by every senator of the United States in the Democratic Party to be the majority leader, was chosen because he was not only a senator from Texas, but a senator of the United States."

Other Democratic presidents in this country--Woodrow Wilson, who served in this city, in this state, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman--all faced difficult and dangerous times. The election of 1932, I think, meant the preservation of freedom here in the United States. But I think the election of 1960 may well mean the preservation of freedom all around the globe."

Mr. Nixon said later this week that that statement was false.  He boasts of tremendous power development during the past eight years, and he asserted that the Russians can overtake us only if we did nothing for fifteen years, while they built eight Grand Coulee Dams a year.  That is his charge and what are the facts?  The facts were reported last year by a committee of the U.S. Senate, over which Mr. Nixon occasionally presides.  That committee's findings, and I quote, were Although the United States is still far ahead, the Russians could overtake us in 1975, in fifteen years, unless we speed up or they slow down.  Both countries will have, the Senate said, an equal power generating capacity which will be 337,500,000 kilowatts in 1975."

What I want to do today is to talk over with you some of my views based on this serious study. At the outset I would like this point clearly understood: the problems of farm people ought not be approached, as far too often has been the case in the past, as something to exploit for political advantage.  Rather, the approach has got to be objective, and has got to be constructive.  In a determined effort to find a solution, the good of the farmer, not the good of politicians, has to be our steady purpose if we are ever to get anywhere."

So, first, because he is a man who understands power and respects it, because he is a man who will use power if he can get away with it, to accomplish his ends, we must make sure that he never believes he is strong enough and that we are weak enough that he could start something without risking national suicide on his own part. And, so, the first necessity of leadership in these critical years ahead is that the United States must continue to be what she is today--the strongest nation in the world.  And, my friends, we must continue to maintain that advantage that we presently have, and the next president must be prepared to ask the American people for whatever was necessary to maintain it because through that strength in our hands, we serve the cause of peace.

And that's the way to get it, and not through just sending it down to Washington to create the jobs through what Washington spends. There was another point that I would make.

He's been traveling in some other country, I can tell you that, because look at this area; look at the state of Florida, the growth here in the last eight years.

He knew that if he didn't go in war would probably be sure because the Communists would sweep down through the Middle East. So, finally, he turned to me. He said, We have got to go in. We went in.

Faced with an urban crisis, the first instinct of many has been to demand vast new government programs and vast new expenditures--whether a Marshall Plan for the Cities, or a doubling of public housing funds or a government-guaranteed income for everyone. Yet even at best, these government programs would only scratch the surface of need. They would drain the federal treasury to soothe the public conscience, but they would fail--because they would leave untapped the greatest reservoir of neglected resources in America today: the energies and the spirit of the American people themselves."

And that need for hospital and clinical facilities is by no means satisfied, as every doctor will agree. I am talking, too, about a sound program which I hope we can develop to reduce the financial hazards of serious illness and remove the fear of husbands and fathers that a sudden accident or sickness will force his family on to public charity. And I don't mean what has been called socialized medicine either."

And it is against Democrats, so far as I can see, not after a sober and considered review of the alternatives, but automatically, as dogs are against cats. As soon as a newspaper--I speak of the great majority, not of the enlightened ten percent--sees a Democratic candidate it is filled with an unconquerable yen to chase him up an alley. "

Its effect is to make the free world itself--both because of its freedom and because of its strength--a potent counter-attraction to Soviet power. And the emergence of this world, united, powerful, friendly and free, will exert an ever-increasing influence on the captive states within the Soviet Empire. "

It is good of you to have come here today. I am happy to have this opportunity to come here myself. Much of our history has been written here in Connecticut, history of which we are all inordinately proud; history which reveals to us many risks."

You today accept the fact that, in the private free enterprise system which we all recognize as basic to our liberty and our prosperity, employees can prosper only as their employers do, and that irresponsible demands are only self-defeating. Yet American labor, like the Democratic party, faces new and uncharted tomorrows. You, as we, will be challenged anew to measure up to the demands of both freedom and power. The future of democracy, perhaps the future of our world, depends upon the exercise of power by America's private and public bodies alike with that self-restraint which separates power from tyranny and orderfrom chaos."

It has been accepted by the best men in both parties. No amount of election year talk can obscure that fact. What the campaign has clearly brought out is that the Old Guard of the Republican party wants to scrap that bipartisan foreign policy--and that their candidate with the new look, the General of the Army, has either forsaken his own great past of becoming the policy partner of Senator Taft and some gentlemen of similarly eccentric views about our world."

Consequently I want to tell you once more, and on your own home grounds."

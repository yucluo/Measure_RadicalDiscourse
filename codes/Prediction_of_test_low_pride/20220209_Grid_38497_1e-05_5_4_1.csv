But I still don't feel that I am wasting my time by coming out here, and I am very grateful to all of you for being here, and to all of these children. I hope you are not cutting school."

And somewhere in this process America has fundamentally changed--a new view, a new compassion, a new faith has emerged. In a way it is a moral revival, and it has altered the tone and the meaning of our life. And how different a prospect faces a young man or a young woman of today from what faced the youth of my generation. The only or, most of all, the go-getter was the hero. Few cared about politics or public service -almost none who went through school or college with me took any positive interest in that, or have subsequently. Few had the sense of civil or social responsibility that we find today, when they were young."

I ask you: to whom should our people entrust the fight against Communism--to those Old Guard Republicans who, on one issue after another, vote the way our enemies like to see them vote? Or to those who have rallied the free world against Communist aggression?"

But that program of service to the people--of the meeting of the people's needs--is still far from complete. We face the immediate problem of counteracting the inflationary forces which have driven our cost of living up too high. So, we of the Democratic party support a strong and firm policy of direct and indirect cost of living controls, while at the same time the Republicans in Congress vote to punch holes in the price controls, in the tax laws, and to end rent controls completely."

Each needs a special sort of ministry. Let us remember that, while Christ preached the doctrine of eternal salvation, he also did the work that needed to be done in the kingdom of man. He healed the sick, fed the poor, sustained the weak, and sheltered all those who were in want. So must we, I think, as Americans continue prudently to extend to the needy of this earth that material help which we almost alone can give. And we ought to do this not grudgingly, but with a clear recognition that it is far better to give than to receive. In a word, the first answer to Communism is not a lesser, but a fuller application of Judaic- Christian ethics to the neighborhood of nations around us."

I have never felt better; I feel frustrated only by the difficulty I have had in engaging in any genuine debate with the Republicans; and, as far as my sense of humor is concerned, I hope it is intact. And I hope the time will never come when the Republican party gets into office and forbids any humor in political campaigns."

And one reason for this is that it has become harder and harder instead of easier and easier to tell precisely what the Republican party stands for in this campaign. I confess it is early in the morning to be harsh about anybody and to be very critical of anybody. I don't want to be critical or harsh. I have in mind that we are now only a week from our election and we still don't know precisely what the Republicans propose to do about much of anything. We know where they stand on the matter of a new labor relations law, for example. That is precisely where they stood for the past five years. That is an old Republican position."

There is a provincial assumption--and fortunately not very widespread--that any man in public life in the South is bound to be a reactionary, or worse.

When so many people get up so early in the morning to hear about the great issues on which we will make a decision next Tuesday, we can all feel confident that the future of America rests in responsible hands. It is a sign that every one of you is taking seriously your duty as a citizen; for, in our country it is the people who make all of the final decisions."

We are for the dynamic system of enterprise which has grown out of the great partnership of public and private initiative in this country.

It is a record of opposition and harassment for 20 years, not only on price supports, but on all of the other Democratic programs on the storage program, rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, rural electric coops and so on.  The Republican Old Guard has never understood the philosophy behind these programs; it has never understood the programs themselves; it has never understood how they work.  The warning is plain; the Old Guard is hoping that the General can make his easy promises to farmers so convincing that they will forget about their own voting record."

Consequently it felt compelled to take its forces out of that region. We are in that war because, having helped set up the Korean Republic, and knowing that strength was being massed against that republic north of its borders, there was a failure to build up adequate strength in Korea's own defense forces."

My first two days were spent in six southern cities. I was interested to see what were the subjects that seemed to interest them most, subjects involving national problems and the national scene, and then to compare those with similar reactions in the north. In my opinion they are identical."

It was always the same and usually, ladies and gentlemen, with the shout along the roadsides and in the crowds, Throw 'em out, Ike; give 'em Hell. That is a battle cry that has now been repeated vociferously, in Philadelphia, even more loudly in Minnesota, yesterday in Cleveland, and I assure you I heard it many times coming in from the airport only a couple of hours ago."

Here is something else we are going to cast out--governmental domination of the people it is supposed to serve.  When I talk about this you may get the idea that I am trying to be philosophical or highbrow, but believe me, this thing affects the lives of every one of us.  Like the rest of the things we will cast out, this too is a product of fear and lack of faith in the people.  This idea that government is the people's master is widespread in our world.  It is called by many names, but it always leads to the same destination.  It puts the gears of progress in reverse and carries society back to the days when the king was government and government was the final goal and the only power."

You people pitched in on your own.  You didn't even wait for a Washington bureaucrat to come down and do it.  You did it yourselves.  Moreover, I am told what you could expect in that little incident, that the elephant stayed on the job working until the last and the donkey played out--just too old, too tired."

We stopped the shooting war in 1945 the strongest military nation in the world, to say nothing of our academic strength and our spiritual, intellectual, scientific and moral strength.  We were the greatest military nation on the globe."

Now, in this crowd, ladies and gentlemen, there are numbers of men who are my old comrades in arms.  Some of them may have fought in the Far Pacific; some may have had duties that kept them in the U.S.; many of them went abroad with me.  And I used to see those fellows along the roads, in the camps, sometimes at reviews, in their barracks, in their kitchen, wherever; and we used to talk about why we were fighting.  And we came to the agreement in simple terms that we were fighting to keep America the kind of land that we believe it to be--a land of freedom and opportunity, not a land dominated by a Hitler or by any group of bureaucrats.  The reason I am in this political campaign, my friends, is in a continuation of that promise.  I am trying to do my part to keep America the kind of country we have always known, which means first of all that you must have a government you can respect and other nations will likewise respect it because you do.

I am glad to have been here to pay tribute to its progress and its record in that field. Now friends, thank you again for turning out.  Let me bring out the better half of the Eisenhower tribe."

Which makes it all the more necessary that we watch with a jaundiced eye anything that is unnecessary--all of the waste, the duplication, the inefficiency that we know about, and which you would not expect me here today at this time to enumerate.  That must be eliminated and it is the second purpose of this crusade."

0.000234175117791858,0.999765824882208,1234_6,0,"This whole-hog theory is that the local citizen--the rancher, the farmer, the municipal government, the state government--don't know anything about their business, and they shouldn't attempt to do anything for themselves but should wait for Washington to tell them how to do it. Now, there are obviously many things that Washington must come in and help if we are going to develop this great West the way it must be developed--and that means to the limit of its capacity to absorb development--but when they do come in, the federal government must come in as a partner; they must take seriously and earnestly the advice and the counsel of the people who are on the spot, and if we don't do that the West will never be developed as it should be. The crusade upon which we are now embarked has that as one of its purposes--in every section, to pay respect, to give due influence to the knowledge and information that local people have on their own problems and not try to do these things from Washington."

All of us have gone up and down the country pledging not only the extension of those programs, but their correction, to make good the losses you have already suffered through inflation--in your bonds, in your savings accounts and in your pensions--and above all, to save whatever value still remains in the dollar.  At least, let's not let it go down from a present worth of 52 cents until it would be worth only twenty-five cents or less. "
0.115391594174343,0.884608405825657,1249_17,0,"There is a cruel duplicity involved on the part of an administration which has pledged social security for some, and then through waste and careless financial policies, has caused an inflationary insecurity for all. And now we come to another glaring example of our national leadership's failure to live up to high ideals.  I refer to the McCarran Immigration Law, which was passed over the president's veto at the last session of Congress.  A new immigration law was certainly needed.  But with leadership, rather than vetoes, we should have had, and we must get, a better law than this McCarran Act."

Second, by skillful, aggressive, and ruthless prosecution of the Cold War, the Soviet Empire has added to its already great resources the important industrial complex of Central and Eastern Europe, and has added to its own large population six-hundred million human beings for use either as slave labor, or as expendable military masses."

So I am not certain what I shall say to you this morning.  I have just been traveling the roads of Nassau County, and never have I been greeted with more cordiality, with greater evidences of hospitality.  I am deeply grateful not only to everyone who was along the road this morning to wave a cheery hello, but to each of you here who has come out to allow me to bring a word of greeting and to express to you one or two of the thoughts on my mind as we go through his political campaign."

Another Republican congressman suggested that classes were too small and that they should go into the evening and run twelve months of the year. And, though President Eisenhower was nominally in favor of aid to education, this particular congressman on April 12, 1956, read into the Record a letter from the President in which Mr. Eisenhower said, I would flatly oppose any grant by the federal government to all states in the Union for educational purposes.

And I want to say something, too, about another kind of indifference. I mean about the crisis in education in this country.

First of all, we must rededicate ourselves to our faith in democracy and make that faith a living principle. In the Middle East, Israel is a beacon of democratic faith and of twentieth century progress. Our policy, therefore, should be founded on the firm cornerstone of the friendship of the American people for its democratic friend--Israel.

I spoke this afternoon at the plowing contest on what I consider to be the number one domestic problem which the United States faces, and that is the sharp decline in agricultural income. I think the farmers of North Dakota and the farmers of South Dakota and of Minnesota and Montana have a very clear choice. The question is which party and which candidate can meet their problems in this state, and meet their in this country. They have heard from the Democratic party and they have heard from the Republican party. I remember when President Truman used to say that the farmers had themselves to blame for their difficulties because they voted Republican in 1952. But I don't hold that view wholly, because in 1952, the farmers were informed that the Republican party stood for 100 percent parity not once but at least three times."

The Senate is Democratic, and we could not mathematically lose control of the Senate. The House of Representatives is Democratic by a wide margin, and I doubt that the Democrats in the House of Representatives will lose control. Therefore, the prospect of four or eight years of a divided government, a government manned by a highly partisan figure, manned by a highly partisan party in the executive branch, and we have seen evidence of it in the last few days--how can we hope, at a time when we need action, how can we hope to possibly move ahead when on the one hand we say yes with the Democrats, and on the other hand we say no with the Republicans? The experience of the month of August in the Congress when both parties were vocally committed to great programs, housing, education, minimum wage, care for the aged--every program fell between the two opposing philosophies of the two parties."

So I address myself to that problem and I feel very strongly about it.  I think I disagreed with Mr. Nixon on it.  He states that he is satisfied with what we are now doing.

If you are satisfied, if you feel happy about your life, if you feel our country is meeting its responsibilities, then you belong in Mr. Nixon's camp.  But if you share the view that I hold very vigorously that this country is going to have to do better in the future, that we have responsibilities to meet not only to ourselves but to the cause of freedom, that we are anxious to make sure that in the future people decide that these days were great days in the life of our country, that we must move forward, we must stimulate our growth, we must hold out an image to the world of a vigorous, dynamic society, if we are going to continue to lead the free world--I believe that is the choice.

The point of the matter is that the Republican party and Mr. Nixon in his fourteen years of association with it have not stood for progress, have not stood for breaking new ground, have not stood for breaking new frontiers, and I believe in the 1960s, if the United States is going to fulfill its potential, if we are going to fulfill the destiny which is in store for us in the sixties, if we are going to be the leader of freedom, we are going to have to move here at home.  I come to Philadelphia and ask your help in this campaign.  This election is the means to an end, and the end is a great, stronger, and growing America.

The thing that ran through my mind I'm sure was what would run through your mind--that the most important question and the most important responsibility for the next president of the United States is to see that those boys and thousands like them are always in uniforms of peace and never have to be in uniforms of war. And so I say to you today that the most important responsibility of the next president is to keep the peace without surrender and that is the question you should ask--which of the candidates--which of the two for president and vice president will best provide that leadership.

Such efforts toward personal security, first, are right--not only from the humanitarian viewpoint, which all of us will understand--they are mandatory if our complex modern society is to work at its best, at its fullest.  They are essential to our purpose.  And what is that purpose?  I think, summed up in a sentence, it is this: we must lift the ceiling over personal opportunity.  We must strengthen the floor over the pit of personal disaster.  Public policy, therefore, should seek to put right what is wrong in our America, but it should also seek to strengthen what is right.  It should recognize the plain fact that Americans are proud and self-reliant individuals.

I pointed this out some weeks ago and it has been frequently reported in the press over the past three years."

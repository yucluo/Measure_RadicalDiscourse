Many thousands of our votes will come from rank-and-file Republicans who will vote with us. No doubt some Democrats will vote for the Republican candidates. We have already, for example, traded a couple of southern governors for the senator from Oregon and the vice chairman of the National Young Republicans. And I regard this as a profitable exchange for us. I would be happy to throw in a second baseman--but not Jackie Robinson."

This is a brave and a generous country, I think we are bearing our responsibilities well as the strong leader of the free nations against the threat of Soviet communism.  We are doing the hard job that must be done if we are to have a secure place for ourselves and for those children.  We are following out the high ideals of Woodrow Wilson, who wanted to take us our full part--give us our full part--accept our full responsibility for securing the peace back in 1920 after the first World War.  The American people didn't listen to Wilson in those days.  We turned instead to people who led us away from the hard road of international cooperation to the easy  path of isolation.  If we had listened to him we might well have avoided the terrible trial of the second World War, in which 300,000 of our young men died."

And we are going to continue to shout and do what we think is right to extend the gains that we have made here at home, and to fight for peace abroad. In the conduct of our foreign affairs we will suffer no tyranny over us, just as we will suffer no tyranny of one American over another.  We want to impose no tyranny on any other people.  We will remain free ourselves--more so.  We will find, as we have found before, the balance between the power we generate and the brakes that will check the power of those hostile to us.  In this way we can move in the wide open world as our fathers did when our nation was founded, and we can move unafraid.  I am reluctant to stop, although I have talked entirely too much, both here and all throughout this campaign.  All the same I have left much unsaid that is in my heart.  All I can do now is to thank all of you and, through you, thank all Americans for the privilege of your attention in these past months."

In seeking desirable amendments, I will ask the advice and suggestions of all groups--public, management, and labor.  And, gentlemen, I assure you that this invitation of mine will be genuine and in good faith.  It will not be one of those empty theatrical gestures so often made in recent years.  In my own mind I have complete confidence that this job of amending the law can be worked out so that no fair-minded member of your group will consider the results unreasonable.  No such legislation must ever be regarded as final, and in considering amendments to labor legislation, labor will have an equal voice.

It makes certain that every time you come back you think more of this country.  If there is any veteran in this whole crowd who didn't have that same feeling when he came stemming into New York or San Francisco or Seattle or Norfolk, then I would be astonished because I have never yet met one who has not said, Well, one good thing a tour abroad does for you; it makes you understand how well worthwhile it is working here at home."

If we do not stop that kind of thing, ladies and gentlemen, then America cannot be what it has been in the past.  We must have a solvent America, an America that lives within its means, yet so far have they gone with these spendthrift policies that the government itself says that last year every city family had to spend $400 more than that family could earn to pay for its shelter, its food, its clothing and other necessities in the family.

They even call the great war in Korea a police action. Ladies and gentlemen, this all adds up to one simple thing--we have got to have a change and I am not expressing here just my individual opinion.  I am bringing to you what I believe I have seen in the faces and I know I have seen in the telegrams and the notes and the letters and the telephone calls of thousands of Americans.  We can no longer put up with that kind of leadership, a leadership that does not bring us closer to peace in the world and they well know that we can have no peace in the world as long as we have a government that cannot excite your pride.  Until it can excite your pride it is not going to earn the respect abroad that it must have if it is going to lead the world toward peace.  In my mind, that is the basic conclusion of American today.  Not only do we need a change, but we are going to have one."

Your governor, your new Senator, your Congressman--we must have them all--and with them and on behalf of all Republicans, I make these pledges to labor, to farmers, to businessmen, to every American:  first, if you want to change administrations this fall, if you want the group that the Republicans can put in the administration and in the Senate and in the House to take charge of this thing--clean it out and start us on a different road than we are now following--then they promise this:  There will be fairness, decency and justice prevailing in that administration, and they will serve you honestly as your servants and will not attempt to be your master.

Sheer bunk!  What the Republicans have said is this:  our purpose is to keep the dollar from going down further so that there will be no further erosion of your savings account, of your bank account, of your insurance policy and of your bonds.  But instead of seeing those things go down the drain of inflation you will keep them, and moreover they have said that where inflation has already overtaken some of these things, these amounts, and they have gone down below decency, that must be corrected, which means corrected upward.  They have also pledged in their platform to expand social security to go to classes not so far covered."

By this I mean the actual cost in dollars is something that you have to add onto all these wasteful and extravagant expenses, as well as the necessary expenses.  But the great damage done to us by corruption in government is, after all, not just the few dollars it takes out of our tax revenues and our pockets.  This mess in Washington lowers our prestige abroad and robs us of pride in our own government.  If we are going to restore pride in government, who is going to do it?  You can't take an organization that has been in power far too long and merely by doing a little face-lifting job, doing a little repaint job, get by with it.  Actually, I believe that the administration candidate said all it needed was a little refreshening.  But as far as I am concerned, how do you refreshen a bad egg?"

I have got, of course, many, many reasons for being pleased when I get out into this country.  Ever since 1919, friends of mine have been asking me out to fish and hunt, and it has been a grand country, but of course, I don't much chance, so I spend a great deal of time reading western stories.  One of the first ones I ever read was written right around here in this country.  I think it was written in Medicine Bow, Owen Wister's The Virginian."

Today, the White House, the State Department, the International Trade Section of the Department of Commerce, the Treasury Department, the Mutual Security Administration, the Point IV planners, the Pentagon, and the international business enterprises go their several, uncoordinated, though well-meaning ways.  Without impinging upon the rights and responsibilities of private enterprise, including private investors, we must coordinate and mobilize mutually-beneficial economic cooperation, as effectively as we mobilize for military defense."

They fear, they say, that these Republican, Independent and enlightened Democratic friends of mine will bring on a depression; that we may be able to lead the country toward peace, but if we do, there will be no jobs, men will be out of work, there will be breadlines--all that sort of bunk.  Now, the first thing that is necessary to lead our country toward peace is a strong America; and the first thing that means a strong America is an employed America--a prosperous America--that stands as an example of what free government can do for its citizens in this world.  That is the purpose to which this crusade is dedicated."

But it happens that we have been the ones who are preaching that the greater fear and the threat of our time is Communism, and the only way to fight Communism is with a prosperous America--an America that is fully employed, with working men and women at good jobs with good pay, with farmers prosperous.  We preached that and taught it and carried it everywhere.  So they had to abandon that."

I hated everybody who hadn't been born ten generations back in the United States, and they thought I didn't know any American Indians, so this looked like a pretty good one.  They said I was anti-Catholic, anti-Negro, anti-Semitic, anti-everything.  Well, that one I didn't have to answer, my friends.  I am very proud of the fine friends of all those groups who jumped into the public print and into the headlines and said, That is just a plain lie, because we know he is not."

But good intentions are not good enough and the country is stalled on dead center--stalled in the middle of the road--while the world goes whirling by. America, which has lifted man to his highest economic state, which has saved freedom in war and peace, which saved collective security, no longer sparks and flames and gives off new ideas and initiatives. Our lights are dimmed. We chat complacently of this and that while, in Carlyle's phrase, Death and eternity sit glaring. And I could add that opportunity, neglected opportunity, sits glaring too!"

Another Republican congressman suggested that classes were too small and that they should go into the evening and run twelve months of the year. And, though President Eisenhower was nominally in favor of aid to education, this particular congressman on April 12, 1956, read into the Record a letter from the President in which Mr. Eisenhower said, I would flatly oppose any grant by the federal government to all states in the Union for educational purposes.

That was when he said, on October 30, 1953, that he favored the election of every Republican over every Democrat for every office any place. And that is the course he has pursued ever since. He has not hesitated to endorse any Republican, be he a Taft Republican or a McCarthy Republican. The only notable exception was an Eisenhower Republican--Senator Wiley of Wisconsin, for whom the President didn't lift a finger. It used to be said that Mr. Eisenhower would reshape the Republican party. You cannot help but wonder today who has reshaped whom."

I remind him that his Secretary of Defense talked about workers out of jobs as kennel or hunting dogs, and that it was a White House assistant who said of unemployment this spring that the right to suffer is one of the joys of a free economy. And I want to say something, too, about another kind of indifference. I mean about the crisis in education in this country. The President said last night that twice in his State of the Union messages--in 1955 and 1956--he urged swift action--and that he even called a conference on education."

They concluded, or rather they hoped, that enough voters would cast a ballot for one man's popularity without regard to the possible consequences if another became President. I think they were wrong. I think the people of this country do not view the vice presidency-- at least in these times-- as a casual incident. They know what the vice presidency is this nation's life insurance policy.

He secures the undeviating loyalty of the majority leader from Massachusetts, John McCormack, his strong right arm, because they know that he speaks not only for Bonham, Texas; he speaks for the United States.

What is true of McDowell County and true of the coal industry will be true of other industries stretching across the United States.

I spoke this afternoon at the plowing contest on what I consider to be the number one domestic problem which the United States faces, and that is the sharp decline in agricultural income. I think the farmers of North Dakota and the farmers of South Dakota and of Minnesota and Montana have a very clear choice. The question is which party and which candidate can meet their problems in this state, and meet their in this country. They have heard from the Democratic party and they have heard from the Republican party. I remember when President Truman used to say that the farmers had themselves to blame for their difficulties because they voted Republican in 1952.

But what is the area of difference between us?  What is the issue on which you should base your decision?  You should not only make a judgment of Mr. Nixon and myself.  You should also make a judgment about yourselves, what you want, about what your view is of your country and your community, about what your view of the future is, whether you are satisfied today or wish to do better.  If you are satisfied, if you feel happy about your life, if you feel our country is meeting its responsibilities, then you belong in Mr. Nixon's camp.  But if you share the view that I hold very vigorously that this country is going to have to do better in the future, that we have responsibilities to meet not only to ourselves but to the cause of freedom, that we are anxious to make sure that in the future people decide that these days were great days in the life of our country, that we must move forward, we must stimulate our growth, we must hold out an image to the world of a vigorous, dynamic society, if we are going to continue to lead the free world--I believe that is the choice.

Mr. Nixon has run on a slogan that we have never had it so good.  It indicates his belief that we are moving in a period now, to quote him, of unparalleled prosperity, that the United States is moving in a position of strength and vitality, and that everything that must be done is being done in good measure.  He looks around the world and he sees the United States with our prestige at an all-time high, and that of the Communists at an all-time low.  I look at the world and I look at the United States, and I don't see his picture at all, and I am not, as the Democratic candidate for office, going to run for the presidency in 1960 with any belief or any view that it is worthwhile getting elected president if we have to run on a platform which is totally unrealistic.  This country is not moving ahead like it is going to have to move ahead if we are going to meet our responsibilities to ourselves, to those who come after us, to those who look to us around the world for leadership.  And our position in the world is not unparalleled; our prestige has been higher.  Our strength relative to that of the Communists has been greater.  If Mr. Nixon hopes to be president of the United States and present the United States to the world in the same image that he now presents it in this campaign, I could not disagree with him more.  I hope you share the view with me that we want the truth with the bark off.  The people of the United States want to face the facts.  You share the same view that I do, that this country's potential is unlimited.  There is no responsibility, no burden, no hazard that the United States cannot meet, but it certainly cannot meet those hazards unless the leadership is prepared to tell the truth.  "

He inherited the greatest nation in the history of the earth. He inherited the most productive and innovative nation in history. He inherited the largest economy in the world.

We will stop the Obama war on coal, the disdain for oil, and the effort to crimp natural gas by federal regulation of the very technology that produces it. We will support nuclear and renewables, but phase out subsidies once an industry is on its feet.

Probably be--be good for America. And maybe it's only symbolic--maybe it's only symbolic, but I believe in an amendment to protect the flag of the United States. It means a lot to veterans and others who've served their country. And it ought to be out there, and it ought to be done, and I'm for it, and he's against it."

I use me too in the grammatical, not the political sense. Which reminds me that there was a big meeting out here yesterday--a sort of bipartisan gathering with representatives from both branches of the Republican party. I don't know how the peace conference got along but they had a good time criticizing us for everything, as usual. They even accused me of the crime of visiting President Truman the other day--a crime that hasn't been committed since Rutherford B. Hayes, because the party in power has not nominated a candidate who was neither a member of Congress nor the Cabinet in seventy-five years. I thought I detected an explanation of their difficulty in finding something to say, however, when the orator of the day, Senator Nixon, revealed that out at the camp in Colorado, General Eisenhower's vacation headquarters, they ate fried mush most of the time.

As a result, we of this generation, who saw farm conditions at their worst in 1932, have had the happy privilege of seeing them over the last decade at their best. I am proud of the work my party has done in these twenty years to restore the American farmer to a position of equality and dignity in our national life. "

It is help of this kind that we can provide by sending agricultural experts, engineers and other trained people to these countries, and through programs of assistance for economic development. By working with each country to expand the production of goods which are needed by other countries in the region, a self-generating and self-financing cycle of trade and development can be initiated, which will reduce and can eventually eliminate the need for American aid. At the same time, we can enlarge or export markets and develop new sources of the products we need to import."

It is good of you to have come here today. I am happy to have this opportunity to come here myself.

You remember the bitter winters of 1930 and 1931. Farmers in Arkansas--conservative, law-abiding farmers--organized to march on towns and loot the stores. Children left home to spare their parents another mouth to feed; so many of them left that the railroads put on special open boxcars to keep the kids from breaking into the closed ones. Millions of American men and women waited in the breadlines. An army of ragged veterans actually marched on our national capital. "

This, perhaps above all others, has been the great contribution of the Democratic party in the last twenty years. In taking the nation out of the worst depression in its history, we reformed the economy so effectively that, under continuing wise leadership, there never need be another disastrous depression such as we have known in the past.

We must continue to meet the present urgent needs of the people. Too many Americans today dwell in misery in tenements in our huge congested cities--second-class citizens living in third class houses. Too many Americans still live in rags in sharecroppers' shacks. Too many Americans find that rising living costs are outrunning their pensions, social security benefits, life insurance proceeds and their salaries. The cost of living and wages have been chasing each other up and up in a dizzy, dangerous spiral of inflation that spells disaster for everyone. And we know what to do about that too, if the Republicans will just keep their hands off."

America is a great, a strong, a wise, and most of all a good country. And I believe with all my heart that by these qualities, we can and we will safely in God's good time win our way to a peaceful world."

I ask you: to whom should our people entrust the fight against Communism--to those Old Guard Republicans who, on one issue after another, vote the way our enemies like to see them vote? Or to those who have rallied the free world against Communist aggression?"

Each needs a special sort of ministry. Let us remember that, while Christ preached the doctrine of eternal salvation, he also did the work that needed to be done in the kingdom of man. He healed the sick, fed the poor, sustained the weak, and sheltered all those who were in want. So must we, I think, as Americans continue prudently to extend to the needy of this earth that material help which we almost alone can give. And we ought to do this not grudgingly, but with a clear recognition that it is far better to give than to receive. In a word, the first answer to Communism is not a lesser, but a fuller application of Judaic- Christian ethics to the neighborhood of nations around us."

That is why one can believe that the importance of bolstering our defenses by the foreign aid programs--Point Four, and things of that kind--are essential if we are going to hope to frustrate the designs of this godless tyranny throughout the world. I thank you so much for affording me this opportunity of participating even briefly in the ceremonies. I count you very fortunate indeed to have this splendid housing development in your neighborhood; and I can add that I am very jealous of it. I should like to be participating in a similar project in Chicago where we too have desperate need of the advantages of public housing."

I am down here for one purpose--to help get rid of the administration in Washington, an administration that has been living on emergencies and crises, emergencies that it manufactures. It likes the emergencies because out of them it makes the rugs, and a rug is a handy thing under which to sweep the evidence of your own errors and mistakes.

It makes certain that every time you come back you think more of this country.  If there is any veteran in this whole crowd who didn't have that same feeling when he came stemming into New York or San Francisco or Seattle or Norfolk, then I would be astonished because I have never yet met one who has not said, Well, one good thing a tour abroad does for you; it makes you understand how well worthwhile it is working here at home."

If we do not stop that kind of thing, ladies and gentlemen, then America cannot be what it has been in the past.  We must have a solvent America, an America that lives within its means, yet so far have they gone with these spendthrift policies that the government itself says that last year every city family had to spend $400 more than that family could earn to pay for its shelter, its food, its clothing and other necessities in the family.

They even call the great war in Korea a police action. Ladies and gentlemen, this all adds up to one simple thing--we have got to have a change and I am not expressing here just my individual opinion.  I am bringing to you what I believe I have seen in the faces and I know I have seen in the telegrams and the notes and the letters and the telephone calls of thousands of Americans.  We can no longer put up with that kind of leadership, a leadership that does not bring us closer to peace in the world and they well know that we can have no peace in the world as long as we have a government that cannot excite your pride.  Until it can excite your pride it is not going to earn the respect abroad that it must have if it is going to lead the world toward peace.  In my mind, that is the basic conclusion of American today.  Not only do we need a change, but we are going to have one."

Of course, it's possible--though I doubt it--that the Savannah River, itself, has its source in a Washington Bureau. This, my friends, is a good year for some straight political thinking.  It is a bad year to be fooled.  It would be a particularly bad year to be fooled into thinking that the Washington mess is the fault of you, the people.  And we will not be fooled into the belief that this great land of ours and the progress we have achieved here are blessings handed down by government.  We are going to think straight--straight through to the conclusion that America is what free Americans--with courage and sweat and drive--have made it.  "

It is in the record as to what the Republican Party expects to do, purposes to do, with price supports, with REA, with cooperatives, with all of those things that mean so much to farm life today.  And that means perishable products as well as nonperishables.  So all of this talk about the Republican Party trying to put the farmer in the poor house is about as weak an argument as they could develop.  They say we want to abolish good times, that everybody will be out with a tin cup on the bread lines.  I made a talk the other night at Peoria where I took to pieces this so-called Democrat prosperity to show that the only advance in living standards the American people have made in the last 20 years was during the five years of World War II.  I do not believe that America wants a prosperity that is based upon the risks and sacrifices that men have to make in uniform against an enemy."

Nine of them have been relieved for malfeasance or for cheating, or for something else wrong.

I have got, of course, many, many reasons for being pleased when I get out into this country.  Ever since 1919, friends of mine have been asking me out to fish and hunt, and it has been a grand country, but of course, I don't much chance, so I spend a great deal of time reading western stories.  One of the first ones I ever read was written right around here in this country.  I think it was written in Medicine Bow, Owen Wister's The Virginian."

Now, there are obviously many things that Washington must come in and help if we are going to develop this great West the way it must be developed--and that means to the limit of its capacity to absorb development--but when they do come in, the federal government must come in as a partner; they must take seriously and earnestly the advice and the counsel of the people who are on the spot, and if we don't do that the West will never be developed as it should be. The crusade upon which we are now embarked has that as one of its purposes--in every section, to pay respect, to give due influence to the knowledge and information that local people have on their own problems and not try to do these things from Washington."

If you believe that as I do, will you join our crusade? This crusade which I have taken to the American people represents what I, myself, believe.  I have acted and I have spoken from my own deep inner convictions of what is best and right for America.  I have been steadfast to my convictions.  I have made no deals.  I am still a no deal man.

I more than ever pledged myself to see that we remove the remaining stains of discrimination from our national life.

But more important even than that, perhaps, is the shunting aside of men who are experienced and trained in a lifetime of conservation work, in favor of politician appointees. The agency that looked at tomorrow's needs for minerals has been disbanded--and nothing put in its place. The Soil Conservation Service has been weakened--and must be revived.

And only last Sunday--just four years ago--Mr. Dulles said in a television interview that the United States, Britain, and France have developed a common policy, and I think it's amazing the degree to which we have had a common policy... and the fact that there are certain minor superficial difficulties as to details about just how you handle tolls, or how much is going to get paid to Egypt and how much isn't, doesn't detract from the fact that we have a common policy.

So I address myself to that problem and I feel very strongly about it.  I think I disagreed with Mr. Nixon on it.  He states that he is satisfied with what we are now doing.

Mr. Nixon could not run on the program that he runs on if he recognized our times.  He could not run on the program that our power and prestige is at its height, that of the communists at the lowest it has been, that everything is all right and being done in its proper measure.  The very fact that he chooses that as his campaign indicates that he could not suddenly reverse in 1961 and determine on action.  If he really believes these things he says, in my opinion he disqualifies himself.  If he does not believe them, and runs on that program, he makes the same mistake that Stanley Baldwin made in England in 1935 which almost destroyed Great Britain, by misleading the people of England in 1935.  He prevented them, by not telling them the truth, he prevented them from arming at a time when it might have been possible to prevent the disaster of Munich."

Jimmy Carter also says he wants to reorganize the federal government. Let me point this out: When he was Governor of the state of Georgia, four years, he increased the number of state employees by 25 percent or more; he increased the spending by the state of Georgia by 50 percent or more; he increased the bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia by over $200 million.

It counts for little if left defenseless in a dangerous world. For 40 years, as its democracy blossomed in the desert, Israel has been assaulted and libeled by the anti-Semitism that is anti-Zionism. And it is assaulted and libeled still today by an infamous United Nations resolution and by terrorists and hostile neighbors, committed to Israel's destruction. But Israel has survived, and Israel has flourished, by effective use of arms when necessary, and then in uneasy peace by the deterrence that comes of well-known military and diplomatic resolve. I make this solemn pledge: That Israel will continue to survive--independent, strong, secure--that America will continue to stand beside her, never wavering in our support, and that the full strategic and economic partnership we've newly forged in the past eight years will be maintained and extended, that nothing will come between us, and that we will together seek a just and lasting peace for the Middle East and for the Jewish people."

This deal says, for people who are poor and their children, eligible for welfare, you still get guaranteed health care, guaranteed food stamps and guaranteed child care if you go to work.

I agree with that. Now what does that mean? That means--you just figure it out for yourselves--that means 2 percent on your car payment, your credit card payment, your home payment. Even more important for the overall health of the economy, it means two percent on those loans that business people need to take out to start those new businesses or to expand the businesses.

It is the same old business day and night. You've got to live it yourself twenty-four hours a day."

You today accept the fact that, in the private free enterprise system which we all recognize as basic to our liberty and our prosperity, employees can prosper only as their employers do, and that irresponsible demands are only self-defeating. Yet American labor, like the Democratic party, faces new and uncharted tomorrows. You, as we, will be challenged anew to measure up to the demands of both freedom and power. The future of democracy, perhaps the future of our world, depends upon the exercise of power by America's private and public bodies alike with that self-restraint which separates power from tyranny and orderfrom chaos."

He has picked up these strange ideas from the men around him--bitter obstructionists who oppose these programs in Congress and who seek now to divert attention from the record with baseless, hollow warnings about iron-fisted regimentation, and a sinister government. In short, the General has fallen victim to the same old Republican oratory we've been hearing for the past twenty years."

You remember the bitter winters of 1930 and 1931. Farmers in Arkansas--conservative, law-abiding farmers--organized to march on towns and loot the stores. Children left home to spare their parents another mouth to feed; so many of them left that the railroads put on special open boxcars to keep the kids from breaking into the closed ones. Millions of American men and women waited in the breadlines. An army of ragged veterans actually marched on our national capital. "

Here, too, people came from all over the United States to begin the great adventures of going west. Beyond St. Louis was an empty land and a great future. "

Today America is more prosperous than any other nation in history. Of course, the Old Guard orators are going around the country these days broadcasting gloomy warnings that our prosperity is a fake, that it is based on war, that a depression will come with peace. This is nonsense. The truth is that our tremendous defense effort is holding us back, gobbling up the goods our people need at home, and when we have at last won through to safer waters, we shall be able to work at a hundred and one tasks that need doing.

We must continue to meet the present urgent needs of the people. Too many Americans today dwell in misery in tenements in our huge congested cities--second-class citizens living in third class houses. Too many Americans still live in rags in sharecroppers' shacks. Too many Americans find that rising living costs are outrunning their pensions, social security benefits, life insurance proceeds and their salaries. The cost of living and wages have been chasing each other up and up in a dizzy, dangerous spiral of inflation that spells disaster for everyone. And we know what to do about that too, if the Republicans will just keep their hands off."

Some of my friends here tell me that misunderstanding has been spread deliberately--that many Texans have never had a chance to see or hear the full text of my statement on this issue, and thus to know exactly where I stand on this question--and why. Consequently I want to tell you once more, and on your own home grounds."

He cannot be appeased; he can never be bought off by the surrender of territory or by the betrayal of some trusting ally, even if we were capable of such treachery.  For his aim is total conquest--not merely of the earth, but of the human mind.  He seeks to destroy the very idea of freedom, the concept of God Himself."

We are opposing it at home where its agents and converts seek to undermine our society and corrupt our government. As I have repeatedly said, the federal government must use all its resources to expose and identify Communistic activity, to keep Communists out of places of responsibility in our society, and to protect our institutions from Communist espionage, sabotage and subversion.

Are these the men we want to lead our nation in the struggle against Communism today? All the while they proclaim ferocious anti-Communism. Indeed, the best way they can apparently find to obscure their retreat from the fight against Communism abroad, the fight to keep it distant from our shores, is by shouting and screaming every hour on the hour about how much they hate Communism at home."

In all events, I am very grateful to all of you for being here this afternoon. I have just had a most interesting experience.

The great transformation which has overtaken our country in these twenty years has come about, in great part, because we have had a new spirit and a new purpose in our government--you could almost feel the change from confusion to confidence, from fear to faith, when the election of 1932 produced a great new leader, Franklin Roosevelt. And that was only the beginning of the process by which America began to lift itself out of the depths, both economically and spiritually, and onto a new plane of social responsibility and of decency. Government assumed responsibilities to avert economic catastrophe and to assure reasonable levels of security for the people. By doing this, great new energies within the people were unlocked. Of course, this new activity on the part of government aroused resentment. The Old Guard began raising their tired old refrain of socialism, and regimentation; you have heard these cries against every new idea in American history since the post office and the public schools."

And one reason for this is that it has become harder and harder instead of easier and easier to tell precisely what the Republican party stands for in this campaign. I confess it is early in the morning to be harsh about anybody and to be very critical of anybody. I don't want to be critical or harsh. I have in mind that we are now only a week from our election and we still don't know precisely what the Republicans propose to do about much of anything. We know where they stand on the matter of a new labor relations law, for example. That is precisely where they stood for the past five years. That is an old Republican position."

I think we must sweep out of the corridors of government, at all levels, national and state, those lingering suspicions which are a holdover from an earlier and very different time.  This is a problem which concerns me very deeply, for I am convinced that both government and business must learn to live together in harmony, before an era of bad temper turns into something infinitely worse. We must avoid at all costs the bitter struggle of class against class, which results inevitably in a drift either to the extreme left or to the extreme right. And you and I know that either kind of drift would end up at the same dreadful destination: a police state with all of the horrors that we have seen in Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia. "

It is the day that marked the adoption of the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution.  In that Bill of Rights it specifies what are the rights of human beings as opposed to the power of government, the limits of what government can do to the individual today, and those ten amendments, possibly coupled with the organization our forefathers gave us, is the real genius of American government.  When those rights, any one of them, comes in peril from within or any threat from without, it is time for every loyal American, not just the rich, not just the farmers, not just the workmen, but everybody.

I was told that the last stop at Grand Rapids, Now, this is where you say goodbye to Michigan.  And then as we came along, a couple of your finest salesmen from Kalamazoo said, We are going to slow up the train as you go through Kalamazoo and you wave at some people.

Well, some things are so false you don't know the right words to use, at least in polite society, for condemning them.  I went to Kasson and on behalf of Republican leaders, and with the concurrence of the great men of the party, at least all that could be reached in time, I stated exactly what we meant to do, and the present 90 percent parity price in the farm program was sustained and supported completely.  Moreover, we pledge that these programs in the future, as it comes time for them to be revised and brought up to date as all programs must be, it will be farmers that will be brought in to Washington whose counsel and advice will not only be sought but, it will be heed."

Now, if we are going to have a fresh start on this thing, we have got to have a complete change in the political complexion in Washington.  I picked up this morning a little clipping.  I am going to read to you just two sentences:  In South Bend, Indiana, yesterday, someone from the crowd addressed by the Democratic candidate, the administration's hand-picked candidate, shouted this question, Would you fire Acheson?   And it says here, Dean Acheson, the Secretary of State, and the answer was this, I will answer questions like that after the election, the Governor replied.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is the only answer the poor man could make.  He has the record, this sorry record of the last seven years to defend, and here is one he can't defend; but he can't on the other hand, say in advance, I repudiate that record and the people who have made it.  But I say, this crusade in which I am engaged does repudiate that record of error, and we are ready to replace from top to bottom.  No one has anything but admiration for the great body of public servants of America who are contained in the civil service and in the uniformed services.  We are talking, in this top to bottom clean-out, about these political appointees, the policy-makers, if you please, of our country--and not only in domestic policy but in this foreign field."

Another Republican congressman suggested that classes were too small and that they should go into the evening and run twelve months of the year. And, though President Eisenhower was nominally in favor of aid to education, this particular congressman on April 12, 1956, read into the Record a letter from the President in which Mr. Eisenhower said, I would flatly oppose any grant by the federal government to all states in the Union for educational purposes.

I think we need an administration which so regards it. We spend $42 billion on defense every year. Those ships sail the oceans. They protect us but they do not serve our people and the world. I do not regard the distribution of food around the world as a great burden upon us. I regard it as an opportunity, to use our assets in a way which will attract people to the cause of freedom.

I am glad we can produce more than we can consume, if we share it usefully, for we are our brother's keeper; and if we have great assets in this country, I believe we should hold out the hand of friendship.

The question is which party and which candidate can meet their problems in this state, and meet their in this country. They have heard from the Democratic party and they have heard from the Republican party. I remember when President Truman used to say that the farmers had themselves to blame for their difficulties because they voted Republican in 1952. But I don't hold that view wholly, because in 1952, the farmers were informed that the Republican party stood for 100 percent parity not once but at least three times."

Mr. Nixon said later this week that that statement was false.  He boasts of tremendous power development during the past eight years, and he asserted that the Russians can overtake us only if we did nothing for fifteen years, while they built eight Grand Coulee Dams a year.  That is his charge and what are the facts?  The facts were reported last year by a committee of the U.S. Senate, over which Mr. Nixon occasionally presides.  That committee's findings, and I quote, were Although the United States is still far ahead, the Russians could overtake us in 1975, in fifteen years, unless we speed up or they slow down.  Both countries will have, the Senate said, an equal power generating capacity which will be 337,500,000 kilowatts in 1975."

Senator Kerry has been wrong—on the wrong side of the defining national security and domestic policy debates for the last two decades. He can run from his record, but he cannot hide."

Yes, yes, we march, we marched for Franklin Roosevelt out of the dark days of the Depression when he said that all we had to fear was fear itself and we marched right on through that Depression and America went on to win a great victory not only over a Depression, but in World War II and we marched with Harry Truman, who told it just like it was and he did something about it, too, for all of us, and we marched and we marched with John F. Kennedy who stood before you eight years ago and said these words to you:  I would like it to be said that in our administration, our country moved, but special emphasis on education, took care of our children and gave medical care to the aged and that we ended discrimination of all kinds in the United States.

Let us at least draw some meaning that is lasting from their martyrdom. As I said here in Los Angeles last night to a large rally in the streets--I have no careful solutions to offer, and nothing that is strikingly new to say. What needs to be said once more all around the world is Let us stop the killing and stop the killing everywhere. Let us stop it here in our own land before we convince our own children that violence is in fact the normal way of life. Let us stop it while we still have the capacity to love one another as human beings--not just the few people right in our neighborhood, our own families and those around us--but people everywhere who, like us, want their years of happiness and life. But if I have anything to say about the course of events in the years ahead, there is one thing, above all else, that I would like to say and do. I would like to make it possible for a child in the Middle East, or anywhere else around this world, to live a full and secure and happy life before that child dies. I want to try to make it possible for that little girl in Vietnam that we saw running into the arms of the camera lens on fire from Napalm to be blessed by the warmth of love rather than the tragedy of war. I want to try and make it possible for people to live as though we really were created in the image of God rather than in the image of our worst fears and suspicions of each other. So I say Peace--not just now, but peace always. I say Peace--not just in one land, but in every land where there are men and women and children who don't know what it is to see a sunrise or to see trees in the springtime. I see and say Peace--on a planet which gives us life, among people who have no right to take it away from others. And I ask, as I did last night, that you say with me, in the words of that great prayer of St. Francis of Assisi, Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. And then we will reap all of the blessings that we, and the generations before us, had hoped for, and our children will bless us because we have given them the fullness of life. That is what I most want for the people of the United States, the people of the Middle East, the people of Southeast Asia and for people who inhabit this planet all around the globe."

On August 25th, the Department of Agriculture, under pressure from consumer and baker's groups, announced that they were lowering the high 47 cents a bushel subsidy. But there was a kicker to that announcement. August 25th, the cut off date, was to last a week.

Now we need a powerful military force but we also need to remember that the great foundation of this nation is based on the health of our people and the quality of our lives and the unity of our homes and our neighborhoods and our communities.

And now we read on yesterday that these grain speculators want to crawl through an unjustified loophole in the tax law known as the Disc System that would exempt 50% of these windfall profits from any tax at all. I want to say here that these fellows are not grain sharks--they are hogs. They want it all.

It is so fundamental to the objectives of our society that it is a shared public responsibility that we support them through revenues and support through the governing bodies of these different institutions.

The average teacher in America today starts at about $14,000 or $13,000 a year.  In some states it's far less.  I was in Florida a year ago, and I saw a teacher's schedule that showed a teacher who had twenty years of teaching with a doctorate degree made $17,000 a year.  I may be off a couple thousand, but I remember being shocked by the figure.  I have talked to any number of young people who went into teaching full of hope and found out they just couldn't stick with it, couldn't afford it.  I talked to a young man in New Hampshire.  I don't think he voted for me based on the returns, but we had a nice conversation.  He told me that, more than anything, he wanted to be a science teacher.  But he had a family of two kids, he was now thirty-six years of age.  He said, I couldn't do it.  I had to get out.  And I made double or triple whatever it was in the private sector.  What is happening today is that a lot of young, skilled people are not going into education.  The tests show that a disproportionate number are testing at the lowest levels of skills and aptitudes.  That doesn't mean a lot of them won't become good teachers.  We ought to have a society in which both in terms of the environment of teaching being honored as a profession and the pay, is such that the very best, the top of each class, goes into education.  I think last year--as I recall, in Los Angeles--I believe I was told that a beginning teacher there made $13,000 and a beginning policeman $28,000.  I don't begrudge the policeman's salary at all.  But we're saying something about teaching when we give it this low status, and, of course, our kids will pay and our nation will pay.  By now we should know that it is the product of the trained mind that is the greatest source of wealth in America.  It's more important than all of our national resources, everything.  That's from an economic standpoint.  But education, of course--that's why I use the word learning--goes to the basis of our democracy, to our personal enrichment and fulfillment, of our understanding of this ever more dangerous world in which we live.  Education does everything that we need.  And it all begins with what goes on in that classroom.  If it's not effective, if we don't have the best teaching, it's not going to work.  As president, I intend to put a tremendous amount of attention on this.  I've spent a lot of my life in it.

He stood for the things I think are right. He stood for them in the way that was right. I think of him particularly today because he retained--as mayor, governor, attorney general and supreme court justice--the humility which is all too rare a quality among democracy's leaders. He never, even from the heights of public service he reached, looked down on people. He always looked up to them. Recalling what Frank Murphy stood for is about the best advice a candidate for the presidency could give himself on Labor Day of this election year."

I don't think the tearful and interminable post-mortems about China will save any souls for democracy in the rest of Asia, the Near East, and in Africa. India is not caught up in civil strife. It can be helped in a way that is natural to us and best for it; help in the ways of peace and of social progress. India has to grow more food. It has to restore its land. It needs new resources of power. In short, it needs a democratic helping hand in the development programs it has already charted for itself."

It seems to me that it is becoming pretty clear that there are two basic things in people's minds as the election in this fateful year of 1952 approaches. One of them is peace. The other, I suppose, is prosperity. It is clear, too, that the position of our two major parties on these issues is precisely the same as it was and as it has been for twenty years. The Republicans say that they are for peace and prosperity, but they don't want to do anything about it. We Democrats say that we are for peace and prosperity, too, and we have been doing something about it, and have been doing it for twenty years."

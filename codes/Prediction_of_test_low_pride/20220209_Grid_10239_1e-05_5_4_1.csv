Above all, our Democratic platform calls for action on the overshadowing problems of war and peace--the most important unfinished business of our generation--and I mean steady resistance to Communism and patient and persistent efforts to build a peace which has been man's dearest goal from time immemorial. Now, in these few words--if these were all that you knew about me and about our Democratic platform, well, I will have to confess that you wouldn't know very much for it is easy to get up here on a campaign train and say some nice sounding words, but out of our party you get a lot more than some high sounding words--you get first of all the record of twenty years of solid accomplishment, of accomplishment in the interests of all our people, and I hope you will compare this record with the Republican record before you vote--for, by the way, they have a record too during these past twenty years, and it is easy to sum up that record. Whenever there has been a forward looking, a constructive program to oppose, they have opposed it, and that is about all their record amounts to."

Each needs a special sort of ministry. Let us remember that, while Christ preached the doctrine of eternal salvation, he also did the work that needed to be done in the kingdom of man. He healed the sick, fed the poor, sustained the weak, and sheltered all those who were in want. So must we, I think, as Americans continue prudently to extend to the needy of this earth that material help which we almost alone can give. And we ought to do this not grudgingly, but with a clear recognition that it is far better to give than to receive. In a word, the first answer to Communism is not a lesser, but a fuller application of Judaic- Christian ethics to the neighborhood of nations around us."

They were merely beautifying the state highway at the access point of the city, where it began to come into the city. And where it had been shabby and ugly and messy they were cleaning it up around there and developing a picnic area--that sort of thing--and an infinite variety of things. Also, of course, from the point of view of the public official, it is a wonderful access point to communities."

I think we must sweep out of the corridors of government, at all levels, national and state, those lingering suspicions which are a holdover from an earlier and very different time.  This is a problem which concerns me very deeply, for I am convinced that both government and business must learn to live together in harmony, before an era of bad temper turns into something infinitely worse. We must avoid at all costs the bitter struggle of class against class, which results inevitably in a drift either to the extreme left or to the extreme right. And you and I know that either kind of drift would end up at the same dreadful destination: a police state with all of the horrors that we have seen in Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia. "

This is a brave and a generous country, I think we are bearing our responsibilities well as the strong leader of the free nations against the threat of Soviet communism.  We are doing the hard job that must be done if we are to have a secure place for ourselves and for those children.  We are following out the high ideals of Woodrow Wilson, who wanted to take us our full part--give us our full part--accept our full responsibility for securing the peace back in 1920 after the first World War.  The American people didn't listen to Wilson in those days.  We turned instead to people who led us away from the hard road of international cooperation to the easy  path of isolation.  If we had listened to him we might well have avoided the terrible trial of the second World War, in which 300,000 of our young men died."

They even call the great war in Korea a police action. Ladies and gentlemen, this all adds up to one simple thing--we have got to have a change and I am not expressing here just my individual opinion.  I am bringing to you what I believe I have seen in the faces and I know I have seen in the telegrams and the notes and the letters and the telephone calls of thousands of Americans.  We can no longer put up with that kind of leadership, a leadership that does not bring us closer to peace in the world and they well know that we can have no peace in the world as long as we have a government that cannot excite your pride.  Until it can excite your pride it is not going to earn the respect abroad that it must have if it is going to lead the world toward peace.

Ever since 1919, friends of mine have been asking me out to fish and hunt, and it has been a grand country, but of course, I don't much chance, so I spend a great deal of time reading western stories.

And now we come to another glaring example of our national leadership's failure to live up to high ideals.  I refer to the McCarran Immigration Law, which was passed over the president's veto at the last session of Congress.  A new immigration law was certainly needed.

They said I was anti-Catholic, anti-Negro, anti-Semitic, anti-everything.  Well, that one I didn't have to answer, my friends.

In that time, as you recall, the great issue was whether this country could stay united, whether it would, in the words of Lincoln, exist half slave and half free.  The issue in the election of 1960 involves not only the well-being of the people of this valley, involves not only the development of your natural resources, but as citizens of the United States and leaders of the free world, we must be concerned about such far-off places as the Congo, India, and Indonesia, the security of those countries, as well as the well-being of their people.

That committee's findings, and I quote, were Although the United States is still far ahead, the Russians could overtake us in 1975, in fifteen years, unless we speed up or they slow down.

Now, as the market price drops so drops the support price.  Where you had $1.50 for corn eight years ago, you may be getting 90 cents for corn today, or 93 cents.  That is the market price.  Mr. Nixon will pay you 90 percent of that market price next year, and if it drops to 85 cents, he will pay you 90 percent of that, and that is the step, down, down, down, until farmers are driven off their farms in increasing numbers."

There are 15 million American homes, according to the last Bureau of the Census, which are substandard.  Mr. Nixon has issued a paper on housing, and this, I think, is most revealing of all and one of the most endearing qualities of the Vice President.  In his position paper issued in New York within the last three weeks, he says that the Housing Act of 1949 has worked very well, and do you know as a congressman he voted against it?  In that position paper he called for greater emphasis on middle-income housing and he voted against that in 1950.  He calls for a greater flow of housing credit so that the American people can buy houses at low rates of interest.  But he neglects to mention his vote as vice president to increase the interest rates on the GI housing bans.  High interest rates never built a single home and one of the reasons why we are building 200,000 less homes each year than we should to keep up with our population increase is because of the high interest rate policy of this administration.

Mr. Nixon has run on a slogan that we have never had it so good.  It indicates his belief that we are moving in a period now, to quote him, of unparalleled prosperity, that the United States is moving in a position of strength and vitality, and that everything that must be done is being done in good measure.  He looks around the world and he sees the United States with our prestige at an all-time high, and that of the Communists at an all-time low.  I look at the world and I look at the United States, and I don't see his picture at all, and I am not, as the Democratic candidate for office, going to run for the presidency in 1960 with any belief or any view that it is worthwhile getting elected president if we have to run on a platform which is totally unrealistic.  This country is not moving ahead like it is going to have to move ahead if we are going to meet our responsibilities to ourselves, to those who come after us, to those who look to us around the world for leadership.  And our position in the world is not unparalleled; our prestige has been higher.  Our strength relative to that of the Communists has been greater.  If Mr. Nixon hopes to be president of the United States and present the United States to the world in the same image that he now presents it in this campaign, I could not disagree with him more.  I hope you share the view with me that we want the truth with the bark off.  The people of the United States want to face the facts.  You share the same view that I do, that this country's potential is unlimited.

What are the issues in this campaign that any voter should consider before they vote?  In my judgment they are two: first, there is the point of view expressed by the Vice President that this country has never been stronger, that our security is assured, that we are experiencing and enjoying unprecedented prosperity from one end of the country to the other, and that the way to win the peace is by journeys through Eastern Europe in order to inform them of the value of freedom.  I want to make it clear that Mr. Nixon may decide, if he is elected, to go to Eastern Europe, but I am going to Washington, D.C., because that is the place.

First of all, let's recognize a fundamental fact. You hear a lot of talk about the farm problem these days, and from a political standpoint it's a difficult one. But let's never forget that there is no greater asset that we have in our struggle with the forces of slavery than the tremendous incredible productivity of America's farmers. Mr. Khrushchev knows this. He told me when he got back to Washington that he was pretty impressed with what he saw on the farms in Iowa that he visited, and he has reason to know it and I'll tell you why: because here in the United States approximately 6.5 million farmers and farmworkers produce as much as 50 million farmers and farmworkers produce in the Soviet Union. That, you see, gives us a tremendous advantage which we must retain. But since we owe this to our farmers, we must see that our farmers get what they do not receive today, and that is a fair share of America's increasing prosperity, and this can be done. The problem is difficult. As I've indicated, I'm going to touch upon it in detail in Iowa on Friday and a speech in South Dakota at the national plowing contest the next night."

So, first, because he is a man who understands power and respects it, because he is a man who will use power if he can get away with it, to accomplish his ends, we must make sure that he never believes he is strong enough and that we are weak enough that he could start something without risking national suicide on his own part. And, so, the first necessity of leadership in these critical years ahead is that the United States must continue to be what she is today--the strongest nation in the world.  And, my friends, we must continue to maintain that advantage that we presently have, and the next president must be prepared to ask the American people for whatever was necessary to maintain it because through that strength in our hands, we serve the cause of peace.  We serve it because we will never use it in aggression.  We will only use it to deter those who would threaten the peace or threaten the freedom of others."

That is your prerogative to judge that, but I can talk about my running mate's, and I say there's no man in the world today who has had more experience, who has done a better job of representing the cause of peace and freedom than Henry Cabot Lodge, our candidate for Vice President, at the United Nations."

Any laboring man who can find a way to support the former governor of Alabama has little or no regard for the union movement.  He has not been your friend and he has not been good for the working man.  But more importantly, he preaches a doctrine of separatism, a dangerous doctrine.  But at least he does it openly.  "

By working with each country to expand the production of goods which are needed by other countries in the region, a self-generating and self-financing cycle of trade and development can be initiated, which will reduce and can eventually eliminate the need for American aid.

Now, actually it doesn't make any difference whether it is Republican or Democratic rascality; a bad public servant is a bad apple and you throw out a bad apple whatever its variety. That is what I believe and I think that is what we are going to do at every level of our government, if the people are conscious enough of what their responsibility is. But rascals in government are only the uglier practices of wasters in government. Economy is just as important as honesty--for a taxpayer's dollar that is wasted is just as bad as a taxpayer's dollar that is stolen. And here again I lay what I hope is not an immodest claim to some hard and educational experience in making both ends of a government budget meet, in keeping a government lean and trimmed down to an efficient size. I have some idea about that; as the product of practical experience in Illinois, I have learned that economy in government isn't just something that you say you are going to have. You have to grind at it all of the time. You have to grind--everybody--up and down the ladder; the purchasing officers who spend millions of the taxpayers' money, the fellows who deal around in government orders, even the girls who want to use a fresh carbon every time they want to write a letter. It is the same old business day and night. You've got to live it yourself twenty-four hours a day."

It seems to me that it is becoming pretty clear that there are two basic things in people's minds as the election in this fateful year of 1952 approaches. One of them is peace. The other, I suppose, is prosperity. It is clear, too, that the position of our two major parties on these issues is precisely the same as it was and as it has been for twenty years. The Republicans say that they are for peace and prosperity, but they don't want to do anything about it. We Democrats say that we are for peace and prosperity, too, and we have been doing something about it, and have been doing it for twenty years."

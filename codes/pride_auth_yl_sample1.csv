I am not going to permit any cuts in the military defense of this country that in any way jeopardize our national security, but I don't want us to forget the warning that the late President Eisenhower gave us eleven years ago when he said that if the military takes more than it needs it actually weakens the country by depriving us of resources that we need to strengthen our health and our schools and our housing and those other things that make up the conditions of national security and national strength.  Now we need a powerful military force but we also need to remember that the great foundation of this nation is based on the health of our people and the quality of our lives and the unity of our homes and our neighborhoods and our communities. We have got to recognize in the decade of the 1970s that whatever the danger is from Hanoi, or Peking or Moscow, those dangers do not present as immediate a threat to the lives and well-being of our people as do the mounting problems of crime and drug addiction and joblessness and bad housing and pollution and all of those things that are making life almost unlivable here in our own society.",dem,1972,TRUE,0,randomly,1,0,0

At the outset I would like this point clearly understood: the problems of farm people ought not be approached, as far too often has been the case in the past, as something to exploit for political advantage.  Rather, the approach has got to be objective, and has got to be constructive.

There are 15 million American homes, according to the last Bureau of the Census, which are substandard.  Mr. Nixon has issued a paper on housing, and this, I think, is most revealing of all and one of the most endearing qualities of the Vice President.  In his position paper issued in New York within the last three weeks, he says that the Housing Act of 1949 has worked very well, and do you know as a congressman he voted against it?  In that position paper he called for greater emphasis on middle-income housing and he voted against that in 1950.  He calls for a greater flow of housing credit so that the American people can buy houses at low rates of interest.  But he neglects to mention his vote as vice president to increase the interest rates on the GI housing bans.  High interest rates never built a single home and one of the reasons why we are building 200,000 less homes each year than we should to keep up with our population increase is because of the high interest rate policy of this administration.

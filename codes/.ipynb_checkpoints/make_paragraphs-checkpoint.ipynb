During the Eisenhower years, when the United States had a fifteen to twenty times greater advantage over the Soviet Union in terms of nuclear capacity, a policy based on massive retaliation all around the world was a credible policy because when you are that far ahead of any potential opponent no potential opponent is going to test you.

That is why we have to have a navy which is the strongest in the world, that is why we cannot be second best in the field of the air force.

There is a second feature which is represented by this head table tonight.  Those of Italian background bring with them a very deep religious faith.  We in America have varying religious backgrounds, but the day when America loses its religious faith, this will cease to be a great country.  Those of Italian background, with their deep religious faith, have helped to sustain the strength of America, the moral strength, which is more important than all the military strength and the economic strength in the world.

There has to be a country moving here in the United States if we are going to be moving around the world. Now, let's see, where were we?  Anyway, the point of the matter is that the United States in the 1960s is going to have to build a society with sufficient vigor, develop its resources with sufficient energy, provide a better life for our people with fair opportunity, with a sufficient sense of justice, if the United States is going to be in fact the leader of the free world.  What we are speaks far louder than what we say we are.  All of the Voice of America, all of the radio broadcasts, all of the books we send abroad, pale in significance to the kind of society that we are building here in the United States.  The reason that Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor here in the United States.  Therefore, I come as the candidate for the Democratic Party.  I come here asking you to join in building a stronger country, asking you to demonstrate, as we sit, in Edmund Burke's words, on a most conspicuous stage, in the most trying and difficult time in the history of the free world, I ask you to help in building here the kind of society which will serve as an example to those who wish to trod on freedom's road.  I come here to Ann Arbor, Michigan, and I ask your support.  Last Saturday, Michigan beat Duke.  And I think on November 8, Michigan and the United States will beat Duke's favorite son and alumnus, Mr. Richard Nixon.  Thank you.\",\n",

But in any event we had many pleasant memories of those months in World War II when we were in this city and I went out from Carbondale to continue training as an Air Force pilot, and I continued and completed my service in that war and near the end of it I made a pledge: that if somehow I survived the years of that war, that I would devote whatever time I had left in life to contributing in some way to the cause of peace and to make sure that if I ever came to a place in the life of this country where I could invest my time and energy on behalf of peace, I would do that to the very best of my ability.

Former President Truman writes in an article some years ago of a conversation he had right here in the state of Illinois with the late Adlai Stevenson when Governor Stevenson was running as a candidate for the presidency of the United States. And they were in a hotel here in Illinois, and they were looking out of the window, and they saw a working man walking across the street and President Truman said: \"Adlai, that is the man that you must not only reach, but he is the man that, if elected, you must speak for in the White House, because the principal difference between our party and the Republican party is that we speak for that man and the Republicans don\\'t give a damn about him.\" ',\n",

That recommendation was to become the central guideline of the Nixon administration during its first two years in office--a deliberate effort to reduce the areas and the opportunities of employment as a means somehow of depressing prices, of depressing inflation, and of dealing with the great economic problems that confront this country. That formula has been a disastrous failure.

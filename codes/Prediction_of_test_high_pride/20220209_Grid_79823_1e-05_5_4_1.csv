America is a great, a strong, a wise, and most of all a good country. And I believe with all my heart that by these qualities, we can and we will safely in God's good time win our way to a peaceful world."

We can win peace in the world without a third world war, but only by dedicating our minds and our hearts, our sweat and our blood to that great task for as long as may be necessary. I tell you that the way to our goal is not easy, but the goal is worth the price, for the goal is nothing less than a nation fair and productive beyond our dreams and a world of law and order where men of good will can live together in equal dignity and under God. This is the future that we seek and this is the future for which I know we are willing to work and to sacrifice and to labor with all of our minds and with all of our hearts, and this is the cause to which we call you. We don't call it a crusade--we just call it, Forward with America."

I am down here for one purpose--to help get rid of the administration in Washington, an administration that has been living on emergencies and crises, emergencies that it manufactures. It likes the emergencies because out of them it makes the rugs, and a rug is a handy thing under which to sweep the evidence of your own errors and mistakes. That is what we have been doing with emergencies."

It was always the same and usually, ladies and gentlemen, with the shout along the roadsides and in the crowds, Throw 'em out, Ike; give 'em Hell. That is a battle cry that has now been repeated vociferously, in Philadelphia, even more loudly in Minnesota, yesterday in Cleveland, and I assure you I heard it many times coming in from the airport only a couple of hours ago."

In seeking desirable amendments, I will ask the advice and suggestions of all groups--public, management, and labor.  And, gentlemen, I assure you that this invitation of mine will be genuine and in good faith.  It will not be one of those empty theatrical gestures so often made in recent years.  In my own mind I have complete confidence that this job of amending the law can be worked out so that no fair-minded member of your group will consider the results unreasonable.  No such legislation must ever be regarded as final, and in considering amendments to labor legislation, labor will have an equal voice.  It is the American way to take what we have and constantly seek to make it better."

It makes certain that every time you come back you think more of this country.  If there is any veteran in this whole crowd who didn't have that same feeling when he came stemming into New York or San Francisco or Seattle or Norfolk, then I would be astonished because I have never yet met one who has not said, Well, one good thing a tour abroad does for you; it makes you understand how well worthwhile it is working here at home."

A little sergeant--Sergeant Kuhlen--I will never forget his name as long as I live--came up with an idea.  He found that he could put some knives on the front of our tanks that would go in and cut off these hedges.  The tanks could come through straight and come through shooting, and it wasn't very pleasant for the Germans. "

You people pitched in on your own.  You didn't even wait for a Washington bureaucrat to come down and do it.  You did it yourselves.  Moreover, I am told what you could expect in that little incident, that the elephant stayed on the job working until the last and the donkey played out--just too old, too tired."

They even call the great war in Korea a police action. Ladies and gentlemen, this all adds up to one simple thing--we have got to have a change and I am not expressing here just my individual opinion.  I am bringing to you what I believe I have seen in the faces and I know I have seen in the telegrams and the notes and the letters and the telephone calls of thousands of Americans.  We can no longer put up with that kind of leadership, a leadership that does not bring us closer to peace in the world and they well know that we can have no peace in the world as long as we have a government that cannot excite your pride.  Until it can excite your pride it is not going to earn the respect abroad that it must have if it is going to lead the world toward peace.  In my mind, that is the basic conclusion of American today.  Not only do we need a change, but we are going to have one."

I am glad to have been here to pay tribute to its progress and its record in that field. Now friends, thank you again for turning out.  Let me bring out the better half of the Eisenhower tribe."

Its causes were many, and its costs in human distress were terrible. It is our pledge that the full power of government and every national resource will be devoted to seeing that it shall never again happen in America."

Sheer bunk!  What the Republicans have said is this:  our purpose is to keep the dollar from going down further so that there will be no further erosion of your savings account, of your bank account, of your insurance policy and of your bonds.  But instead of seeing those things go down the drain of inflation you will keep them, and moreover they have said that where inflation has already overtaken some of these things, these amounts, and they have gone down below decency, that must be corrected, which means corrected upward.  They have also pledged in their platform to expand social security to go to classes not so far covered."

You give me a chance to look in your faces, to bring you a word of greeting, and to give you one or two of the thoughts that are on my mind as we go through this political campaign.  I have had a wonderful day and a half in your state, starting up at Sacramento.  It seems to me I have been covering ground very rapidly and every place there seems to be a new surprise.  Now, for example, here when the so-called professional politicians began to give me my lessons in this new art a few months back, they told me there was one thing you could not do-go to an airport and address a group of American citizens.  I was told they simply wouldn't come.  So I find out today that at least in Long Beach those political friends of mine were wrong, and I am delighted."

The first thing I find is a wash-rag and it says, Clean up with Ike. I have got, of course, many, many reasons for being pleased when I get out into this country.  Ever since 1919, friends of mine have been asking me out to fish and hunt, and it has been a grand country, but of course, I don't much chance, so I spend a great deal of time reading western stories.  One of the first ones I ever read was written right around here in this country.  I think it was written in Medicine Bow, Owen Wister's The Virginian."

All of us have gone up and down the country pledging not only the extension of those programs, but their correction, to make good the losses you have already suffered through inflation--in your bonds, in your savings accounts and in your pensions--and above all, to save whatever value still remains in the dollar.  At least, let's not let it go down from a present worth of 52 cents until it would be worth only twenty-five cents or less. "

I believe that the wrecking of the London Economic Conference of 1933 was one of the great, though little understood, tragedies of our modern world.  We must make a fresh start."

They fear, they say, that these Republican, Independent and enlightened Democratic friends of mine will bring on a depression; that we may be able to lead the country toward peace, but if we do, there will be no jobs, men will be out of work, there will be breadlines--all that sort of bunk.  Now, the first thing that is necessary to lead our country toward peace is a strong America; and the first thing that means a strong America is an employed America--a prosperous America--that stands as an example of what free government can do for its citizens in this world.  That is the purpose to which this crusade is dedicated."

We could make some allowance for them if they had the honesty or the common sense, or both, to admit that they had been deceived and to show a stern purpose of preventing similar subversion in the future. There has been considerable concern--and rightfully so--about methods to be used in rooting Communism out of our government."

The AFL and CIO presented them with a golden chance to do just this when it called for an international convention against the use of slave labor. Here was a chance to place the United States in a position of active moral leadership, to mobilize the full force of world opinion against the Soviet institution of forced labor, and to establish our sympathy with the cause of these valiant workers behind the Iron Curtain who had risked their lives in the effort to throw off the yoke of servitude."

That was when he said, on October 30, 1953, that he favored the election of every Republican over every Democrat for every office any place. And that is the course he has pursued ever since. He has not hesitated to endorse any Republican, be he a Taft Republican or a McCarthy Republican. The only notable exception was an Eisenhower Republican--Senator Wiley of Wisconsin, for whom the President didn't lift a finger. It used to be said that Mr. Eisenhower would reshape the Republican party. You cannot help but wonder today who has reshaped whom."

First of all, we must rededicate ourselves to our faith in democracy and make that faith a living principle. In the Middle East, Israel is a beacon of democratic faith and of twentieth century progress. Our policy, therefore, should be founded on the firm cornerstone of the friendship of the American people for its democratic friend--Israel. For three years we have tried the ignoble, expedient policy of isolating Israel and trying to buy the friendship of dictators. Colonel Nasser has given us his answer.

I think we need an administration which so regards it. We spend $42 billion on defense every year. Those ships sail the oceans. They protect us but they do not serve our people and the world. I do not regard the distribution of food around the world as a great burden upon us. I regard it as an opportunity, to use our assets in a way which will attract people to the cause of freedom. I am glad that this is our problem, and not starvation. I am glad we can produce more than we can consume, if we share it usefully, for we are our brother's keeper; and if we have great assets in this country, I believe we should hold out the hand of friendship. When hundreds of millions of people stagger through their lives searching for food and we have it, and we are trying to determine which way the world will go, I would rather see our food used in an imaginative way than to argue in kitchens or anyplace else.

Mr. Nixon has chosen a different road.  He has gone to the American people in the 1960s, in the time of change and revolution, saying, We've never had it so good, saying our prestige in the world has never been higher.  I recall in 1935, when Winston Churchill was warning of the dangers of the Nazi rise, Stanley Baldwin, the leader of the Conservative party, told the people of England that everything was being done in its own good time.

First of all, let's recognize a fundamental fact. You hear a lot of talk about the farm problem these days, and from a political standpoint it's a difficult one. But let's never forget that there is no greater asset that we have in our struggle with the forces of slavery than the tremendous incredible productivity of America's farmers. Mr. Khrushchev knows this. He told me when he got back to Washington that he was pretty impressed with what he saw on the farms in Iowa that he visited, and he has reason to know it and I'll tell you why: because here in the United States approximately 6.5 million farmers and farmworkers produce as much as 50 million farmers and farmworkers produce in the Soviet Union. That, you see, gives us a tremendous advantage which we must retain. But since we owe this to our farmers, we must see that our farmers get what they do not receive today, and that is a fair share of America's increasing prosperity, and this can be done. The problem is difficult. As I've indicated, I'm going to touch upon it in detail in Iowa on Friday and a speech in South Dakota at the national plowing contest the next night."

I think we must emphasize the things that unite America.  I pointed out in speaking to a great labor organization yesterday the fact that Mr. Kennedy had been in Detroit and made the statement that he was for everything union leaders were for, in effect, and that he opposed everything that they were against.  And I said to this group, Look, I'm for many of the things your leaders are for, but I'm not for all the things and I will not make a commitment that I'm for all the things that the leaders of unions or management or farm organizations or any other part or group of America are for, because a president must be president of all America and not just part of America."

All the criticism in the world of the Eisenhower record in the field of foreign policy isn't going to fool the American people because they know what it is and they like it.  They know that in 1953, when Eisenhower became president, we were in a war.

And so, one, we will keep America strong militarily, and the second thing we will do is this.  We will be firm in our diplomacy.  We know this man as I emphasized.  We know that he doesn't react like the leaders of the free world.  We know that the naive and well-intentioned people who suggest that a concession here or a concession there will lead to peace forget the lessons of history.  My friends, we learned in Korea, we learned in dealing with Hitler, that whenever you're confronted with a dictator the way to peace is to strengthen strength and firmness, and the way to war is through weakness, both militarily and diplomatically.

Yes, yes, we march, we marched for Franklin Roosevelt out of the dark days of the Depression when he said that all we had to fear was fear itself and we marched right on through that Depression and America went on to win a great victory not only over a Depression, but in World War II and we marched with Harry Truman, who told it just like it was and he did something about it, too, for all of us, and we marched and we marched with John F. Kennedy who stood before you eight years ago and said these words to you:  I would like it to be said that in our administration, our country moved, but special emphasis on education, took care of our children and gave medical care to the aged and that we ended discrimination of all kinds in the United States.  He said, and I say, we want fair treatment for all Americans.  that is the Democratic program.

That's why we are proud to be Democrats.

I was at Milt and Roslyn's home, the Embassy in Austria, when we negotiated the SALT II treaty. Eisenhower was for nuclear arms control. All the Republican presidents since then were for nuclear arms control. Every Democratic President since Truman have been for nuclear arms control. To give up the thought that we could have so-called nuclear superiority--because when you adopt a policy of nuclear superiority, it means that you cannot negotiate mutual and balanced restraints or reductions--and for us to abandon the hope or the prospect of having nuclear weapons controlled in our own country, in the Soviet Union, and particularly among those nations that don't have nuclear weapons yet, that is indeed a radical departure in the prospects for peace in the future."

Today America is more prosperous than any other nation in history. Of course, the Old Guard orators are going around the country these days broadcasting gloomy warnings that our prosperity is a fake, that it is based on war, that a depression will come with peace. This is nonsense. The truth is that our tremendous defense effort is holding us back, gobbling up the goods our people need at home, and when we have at last won through to safer waters, we shall be able to work at a hundred and one tasks that need doing.

It has been accepted by the best men in both parties. No amount of election year talk can obscure that fact. What the campaign has clearly brought out is that the Old Guard of the Republican party wants to scrap that bipartisan foreign policy--and that their candidate with the new look, the General of the Army, has either forsaken his own great past of becoming the policy partner of Senator Taft and some gentlemen of similarly eccentric views about our world."

And I say to you as I have said many times to them: They deserve better leadership than they are getting--better and more trustworthy. What do the Democrats say about Social Security? We say--and I am quoting the pledge written into the 1952 Democratic party platform:

And I hope you will also think hard about what kind of foreign policy you want this country to follow in the years ahead. We face a long, tough, bitter struggle to preserve freedom in the world. We know in our hearts, all of us, that it is childish to suppose there is any simple solution, any easy answer. The lives of our sons are involved now, while we are fighting in Korea. The lives of everyone would be involved if that conflict were to grow into world war."

The issue then was whether the government would help make water available for small farmers who wanted to settle on new land. Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican president, put through that law, and we honor him for it. But as Theodore Roosevelt himself noted in his autobiography, he put the law through over the bitter opposition of the Old Guard Republicans in Congress. He observed that they consistently vote for local and private interests and against the interest of the people as a whole. And note, too that the original Reclamation Law was sponsored in the House of Representatives by Representative Newlands of Nevada, a Democrat. It passed by the votes of 77 Democrats and 69 Republicans."

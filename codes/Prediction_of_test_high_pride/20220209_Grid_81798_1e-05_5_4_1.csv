We are opposing it at home where its agents and converts seek to undermine our society and corrupt our government. As I have repeatedly said, the federal government must use all its resources to expose and identify Communistic activity, to keep Communists out of places of responsibility in our society, and to protect our institutions from Communist espionage, sabotage and subversion.

Such a war is unthinkable and would destroy the very people and the civilization that we seek to save. Yet the day of liberation will come, and there is much we can do in the meantime to help the unhappy people of Eastern Europe. Through the United Nations much is being done to rally the conscience of mankind. We can offer help and encouragement to those thousands of families and those individuals who are escaping, month by month, through the chinks in the Iron Curtain."

We can win peace in the world without a third world war, but only by dedicating our minds and our hearts, our sweat and our blood to that great task for as long as may be necessary. I tell you that the way to our goal is not easy, but the goal is worth the price, for the goal is nothing less than a nation fair and productive beyond our dreams and a world of law and order where men of good will can live together in equal dignity and under God. This is the future that we seek and this is the future for which I know we are willing to work and to sacrifice and to labor with all of our minds and with all of our hearts, and this is the cause to which we call you. We don't call it a crusade--we just call it, Forward with America."

And one reason for this is that it has become harder and harder instead of easier and easier to tell precisely what the Republican party stands for in this campaign. I confess it is early in the morning to be harsh about anybody and to be very critical of anybody. I don't want to be critical or harsh. I have in mind that we are now only a week from our election and we still don't know precisely what the Republicans propose to do about much of anything. We know where they stand on the matter of a new labor relations law, for example. That is precisely where they stood for the past five years. That is an old Republican position."

And we are going to continue to shout and do what we think is right to extend the gains that we have made here at home, and to fight for peace abroad. In the conduct of our foreign affairs we will suffer no tyranny over us, just as we will suffer no tyranny of one American over another.  We want to impose no tyranny on any other people.  We will remain free ourselves--more so.  We will find, as we have found before, the balance between the power we generate and the brakes that will check the power of those hostile to us.  In this way we can move in the wide open world as our fathers did when our nation was founded, and we can move unafraid.  I am reluctant to stop, although I have talked entirely too much, both here and all throughout this campaign.  All the same I have left much unsaid that is in my heart.  All I can do now is to thank all of you and, through you, thank all Americans for the privilege of your attention in these past months."

And I thank them every one for the reception they have given me--for their infinite courtesy and their heartening friendliness.  I have asked you for your support for my candidacy.

I am down here for one purpose--to help get rid of the administration in Washington, an administration that has been living on emergencies and crises, emergencies that it manufactures. It likes the emergencies because out of them it makes the rugs, and a rug is a handy thing under which to sweep the evidence of your own errors and mistakes.

Once we have gotten that thought in our minds so that we never forget it, ladies and gentlemen, we can clean out corruption.  Why, think of it, think of the votes we can roll up on November 4th.  We can bring down taxes; we can stop the terrific taxes that are piling up your prices.  An economist came into me the other day, one of these fellows, you know, that dig out the facts.  Every time you eat a boiled egg, unless you raise it yourself, you pay 100 taxes on that egg, one hundred taxes and then we wonder where the prices come from."

But then I think of you people who work not only on an intensive basis like that part of the time, but all the time, keeping the party together, keeping it financed, keeping it presented properly before all the people, and I realize what public service really means.

What I am discussing as I go around is the incompetent leadership you have gotten over the past seven years from your administration in Washington.  And I go into the various subjects of our lack of progress toward peace, our excessive expenditures on the federal level, the deficits that are cheapening our money, the crises that are going up, the taxes that grow more and more burdensome; and, with all of the necessary expenditures for defense organisms that we must have, still a kind of incompetence in government that gets two airfields in North Africa for the price of five and the kind of thing going on in the Justice Department that led an ex-under secretary, a high official in the Justice Department, to say only yesterday, Why, if my ex-chief should tell all he knew, they would blow the White House so high that the power of gravity could not bring it back."

Of course, it's possible--though I doubt it--that the Savannah River, itself, has its source in a Washington Bureau. This, my friends, is a good year for some straight political thinking.  It is a bad year to be fooled.  It would be a particularly bad year to be fooled into thinking that the Washington mess is the fault of you, the people.  And we will not be fooled into the belief that this great land of ours and the progress we have achieved here are blessings handed down by government.  We are going to think straight--straight through to the conclusion that America is what free Americans--with courage and sweat and drive--have made it.  "

It should be remembered that the negative votes on the North Atlantic Treaty, the Vandenberg Resolution and the Marshall Plan included negative votes of the party in power.  That is a tribute not just to a man but to a party.  Senator Vandenberg, if he were living, would be the first one to resent the suggestion that the votes to which I refer represented a personal triumph.  Rather, they represented to him the dedication of a party which, although it was an opposition party, subordinated partisan considerations to the national welfare."

There can be no peace in this world until there is a strong America leading us toward peace--strong spiritually, economically, financially, and finally militarily. We are going to have that kind of strength only if we are united behind a government that excites our pride.  Such a government will have great prestige abroad; the free countries will want to join with us in establishing a collective security."

Which makes it all the more necessary that we watch with a jaundiced eye anything that is unnecessary--all of the waste, the duplication, the inefficiency that we know about, and which you would not expect me here today at this time to enumerate.

I have just been traveling the roads of Nassau County, and never have I been greeted with more cordiality, with greater evidences of hospitality.  I am deeply grateful not only to everyone who was along the road this morning to wave a cheery hello, but to each of you here who has come out to allow me to bring a word of greeting and to express to you one or two of the thoughts on my mind as we go through his political campaign."

It was this: There was quoted a top-secret document of the American Defense Department. How it got there, we will never know probably. But that top-secret document brought out one fact that really answers your question. It was this. There was a military estimate made in September 1947 by military men, and it had this conclusion: The military occupation of South Korea is not essential to the military security of the United States of America."

It was a very, very wonderful promise.  I sincerely appreciated it, but what has happened?  If you are going to educate, you have to start with the record, with the facts.  Who among you here would like the job of defending the record of the government of the past seven years?  Well, I don't have to ask that one again.  Of course, they can't defend that record, a record in which, with all of the assets and resources of this great nation with which we came out of World War II, they have frittered them away--as they have struggled and fumbled and stumbled and fallen in the foreign field.  They have brought us no closer to peace.  We have had these emergencies after emergencies.  We have lost China.  We have lost souls, human souls, to the Communistic dictatorship in the Kremlin at the rate of 100 million per year."

I do want to thank each of you who has come out here this morning and given me this time from his busy day not only to bring him a greeting but to allow me to express a few of these thoughts that are on my mind as we go through this political campaign.  I haven't anything in shopworn promises to offer you, but I do tell you this:  When this campaign started and we had some smoothly flowing, high sounding language from the opposition as to what they were going to do--I made a pledge."

I hated everybody who hadn't been born ten generations back in the United States, and they thought I didn't know any American Indians, so this looked like a pretty good one.  They said I was anti-Catholic, anti-Negro, anti-Semitic, anti-everything.  Well, that one I didn't have to answer, my friends.  I am very proud of the fine friends of all those groups who jumped into the public print and into the headlines and said, That is just a plain lie, because we know he is not."

The projects that have been built are monuments to the hard and persistent work of your representatives in Congress, of men like John McClellan and Bill Fulbright and the members of your House delegation.

I remind him that his Secretary of Defense talked about workers out of jobs as kennel or hunting dogs, and that it was a White House assistant who said of unemployment this spring that the right to suffer is one of the joys of a free economy. And I want to say something, too, about another kind of indifference. I mean about the crisis in education in this country. The President said last night that twice in his State of the Union messages--in 1955 and 1956--he urged swift action--and that he even called a conference on education."

They concluded, or rather they hoped, that enough voters would cast a ballot for one man's popularity without regard to the possible consequences if another became President. I think they were wrong. I think the people of this country do not view the vice presidency-- at least in these times-- as a casual incident. They know what the vice presidency is this nation's life insurance policy.

There has been special medical research in the diseases of the aged. There have been special programs started in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare so that the people that are chronically ill, although not acutely ill, could have proper hospital care or proper care within a hospital center.

The men of the opposition know perfectly well that one of the main reasons they were thrown out of office four years ago was their tolerance of the thievery of inflation.

The day of liberation may be postponed where armed forces for a time make protest suicidal.

Now, as the market price drops so drops the support price.  Where you had $1.50 for corn eight years ago, you may be getting 90 cents for corn today, or 93 cents.  That is the market price.

Mr. Nixon has chosen a different road.

The average teacher in America today starts at about $14,000 or $13,000 a year.  In some states it's far less.  I was in Florida a year ago, and I saw a teacher's schedule that showed a teacher who had twenty years of teaching with a doctorate degree made $17,000 a year.  I may be off a couple thousand, but I remember being shocked by the figure.  I have talked to any number of young people who went into teaching full of hope and found out they just couldn't stick with it, couldn't afford it.  I talked to a young man in New Hampshire.  I don't think he voted for me based on the returns, but we had a nice conversation.  He told me that, more than anything, he wanted to be a science teacher.  But he had a family of two kids, he was now thirty-six years of age.  He said, I couldn't do it.  I had to get out.  And I made double or triple whatever it was in the private sector.  What is happening today is that a lot of young, skilled people are not going into education.  The tests show that a disproportionate number are testing at the lowest levels of skills and aptitudes.  That doesn't mean a lot of them won't become good teachers.  We ought to have a society in which both in terms of the environment of teaching being honored as a profession and the pay, is such that the very best, the top of each class, goes into education.  I think last year--as I recall, in Los Angeles--I believe I was told that a beginning teacher there made $13,000 and a beginning policeman $28,000.  I don't begrudge the policeman's salary at all.  But we're saying something about teaching when we give it this low status, and, of course, our kids will pay and our nation will pay.  By now we should know that it is the product of the trained mind that is the greatest source of wealth in America.  It's more important than all of our national resources, everything.  That's from an economic standpoint.  But education, of course--that's why I use the word learning--goes to the basis of our democracy, to our personal enrichment and fulfillment, of our understanding of this ever more dangerous world in which we live.  Education does everything that we need.  And it all begins with what goes on in that classroom.  If it's not effective, if we don't have the best teaching, it's not going to work.  As president, I intend to put a tremendous amount of attention on this.  I've spent a lot of my life in it.

And what are the specific things we can do in moving toward the human goals we hold in common? We can start, because the opportunity is so obvious, by making the Department of Labor a more effective service agency. To mention a few specific responsibilities here is to suggest many others:"

Those who let their politics impeach their honesty tell you that inflation is the product of governmental waste and mismanagement. Whether this is legitimate politics I shall not presume to say. But as an explanation of the causes of inflation, it is pure poppycock. It's like a husband coming into the kitchen, seeing one potato peeling that is too thick, and exploding that now he knows why you can't make ends meet. I'm for the government's peeling its potatoes with a sharp knife and a miserly eye. And I've done some sharp and miserly peeling in Illinois myself. But I'm not going to fool myself or you that meeting a nation's inflation problem is that simple."

They cut out $300,000 and added $50,000,000! But I vetoed most of it; I vetoed more appropriations than any governor in Illinois history. So you will understand when I say that I think the carefully cultivated legend that all Democrats are wasters and all Republicans are economical is the bunk. I think this is a time for bare-bone economy and the Republican legislators in Illinois can tell you I mean what I say."

His name is Senator Tom Underwood, and you know what to do about him on November 4."

He has picked up these strange ideas from the men around him--bitter obstructionists who oppose these programs in Congress and who seek now to divert attention from the record with baseless, hollow warnings about iron-fisted regimentation, and a sinister government. In short, the General has fallen victim to the same old Republican oratory we've been hearing for the past twenty years."

You remember the bitter winters of 1930 and 1931. Farmers in Arkansas--conservative, law-abiding farmers--organized to march on towns and loot the stores. Children left home to spare their parents another mouth to feed; so many of them left that the railroads put on special open boxcars to keep the kids from breaking into the closed ones. Millions of American men and women waited in the breadlines. An army of ragged veterans actually marched on our national capital. "

One is peace and the other is prosperity.  And it is clear, too, that the position of the two parties on these issues is exactly the same as it has been for the last twenty years. The Republicans say that they are for peace and prosperity--but they don't want to do anything about it. The Democrats are for peace and prosperity too, and we have been doing something about it and we are going to go on doing something about it. "

Our programs grow from what we think are people's needs--and I don't mean just a few people--I mean all of the people. And that means equality of opportunity for all, regardless of race and color or creed. Most of all today we stand for peace--not for another war to end all wars, but for peace without war. We are not making the promises that the Republicans are, and we don't play politics with promises we know we cannot keep. We are trying to talk straight to the American people. We are recognizing that the course ahead of us is a stern course; that there are no easy, cheap solutions for Communism, for want, for hunger, for all of the miseries that torment our world. But we believe with all of our hearts that if we make this nation strong we can keep good times at home and avoid that war that would destroy the world. "

We take our stand upon the fundamental principle that the role of government is, to sum up, just this: To remove the roadblocks put in the way of the people by nature and by greedy men; to release the energies of the people, so that free men may work the miracles of the future as they have worked the miracles of the past.  No man could travel across our country, as I have done, without being deeply stirred. No man then--his heart touched and his mind moved--could but reflect upon his country's destiny, his love for it the greater as perils encompass it. As we walk through a troubled time, let us remember that the United States was born to greatness. "

He wants you to believe the Republican party will make good on it. Well, the Republicans made the same pledge--the same promise--in their 1944 platform. But what happened? Two years later they gained control of the Eightieth Congress. They had a chance to make good on their promise. Did they make good? They not only did not fulfill that pledge--they actually took social security coverage away from more than a half million people."

Some of my friends here tell me that misunderstanding has been spread deliberately--that many Texans have never had a chance to see or hear the full text of my statement on this issue, and thus to know exactly where I stand on this question--and why. Consequently I want to tell you once more, and on your own home grounds."

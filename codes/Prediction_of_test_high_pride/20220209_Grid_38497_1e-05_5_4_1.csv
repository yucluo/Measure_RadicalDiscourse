Are these the men we want to lead our nation in the struggle against Communism today? All the while they proclaim ferocious anti-Communism. Indeed, the best way they can apparently find to obscure their retreat from the fight against Communism abroad, the fight to keep it distant from our shores, is by shouting and screaming every hour on the hour about how much they hate Communism at home."

And we are going to continue to shout and do what we think is right to extend the gains that we have made here at home, and to fight for peace abroad. In the conduct of our foreign affairs we will suffer no tyranny over us, just as we will suffer no tyranny of one American over another.  We want to impose no tyranny on any other people.  We will remain free ourselves--more so.  We will find, as we have found before, the balance between the power we generate and the brakes that will check the power of those hostile to us.  In this way we can move in the wide open world as our fathers did when our nation was founded, and we can move unafraid.  I am reluctant to stop, although I have talked entirely too much, both here and all throughout this campaign.  All the same I have left much unsaid that is in my heart.  All I can do now is to thank all of you and, through you, thank all Americans for the privilege of your attention in these past months."

It was always the same and usually, ladies and gentlemen, with the shout along the roadsides and in the crowds, Throw 'em out, Ike; give 'em Hell. That is a battle cry that has now been repeated vociferously, in Philadelphia, even more loudly in Minnesota, yesterday in Cleveland, and I assure you I heard it many times coming in from the airport only a couple of hours ago."

A little sergeant--Sergeant Kuhlen--I will never forget his name as long as I live--came up with an idea.  He found that he could put some knives on the front of our tanks that would go in and cut off these hedges.  The tanks could come through straight and come through shooting, and it wasn't very pleasant for the Germans. "

At times the pitiless pressure of Communism has been checked by brave emergency attempts that rallied men of all parties to make up the deficiencies in our national leadership.  These attempts have produced the economic help of the Marshall Plan and the program of military aid to Greece and Turkey.  Both were enactments of the Republican 80th Congress, the Congress so long vilified by the administration.  These measures have helped to steady both the economic and the nervous systems of our allies.  They could hardly have been expected to do more in the making of our foreign policy.  Dollars and guns are no substitute for brains and willpower."

By this I mean the actual cost in dollars is something that you have to add onto all these wasteful and extravagant expenses, as well as the necessary expenses.  But the great damage done to us by corruption in government is, after all, not just the few dollars it takes out of our tax revenues and our pockets.  This mess in Washington lowers our prestige abroad and robs us of pride in our own government.  If we are going to restore pride in government, who is going to do it?  You can't take an organization that has been in power far too long and merely by doing a little face-lifting job, doing a little repaint job, get by with it.  Actually, I believe that the administration candidate said all it needed was a little refreshening.  But as far as I am concerned, how do you refreshen a bad egg?"

Which makes it all the more necessary that we watch with a jaundiced eye anything that is unnecessary--all of the waste, the duplication, the inefficiency that we know about, and which you would not expect me here today at this time to enumerate.  That must be eliminated and it is the second purpose of this crusade."

They will be consulted, and not the way they are consulted now:  You do this or you will get no more.  They will be consulted on what is the problem of their locality.

Now, there are obviously many things that Washington must come in and help if we are going to develop this great West the way it must be developed--and that means to the limit of its capacity to absorb development--but when they do come in, the federal government must come in as a partner; they must take seriously and earnestly the advice and the counsel of the people who are on the spot, and if we don't do that the West will never be developed as it should be. The crusade upon which we are now embarked has that as one of its purposes--in every section, to pay respect, to give due influence to the knowledge and information that local people have on their own problems and not try to do these things from Washington."

All of us have gone up and down the country pledging not only the extension of those programs, but their correction, to make good the losses you have already suffered through inflation--in your bonds, in your savings accounts and in your pensions--and above all, to save whatever value still remains in the dollar.

This party in power in the last seven years has used up every possible political promise there is, and some of them have gotten pretty shopworn.  For example, there is no easier way to duck an issue than to say this, I will promise you a law, well knowing they cannot deliver it.  There is no easier way to get out of a situation.  What I promise you is work, never ending work, to make certain that justice is done.  So I cannot come before you with the competition of promises, but I do come before you with a pledge, and this is the pledge.  If you want to put this crusade at the helm of your government; if you want to substitute for these 22 caliber men who are trying to hold 45 caliber jobs the finest men and women that we can draw from all sections of this country, from every walk of life--and let me say plainly, based upon merit and without respect to color or creed; if you want to have a government of that kind, then you belong in this crusade."

No agency, public or private, has been more effective in arousing the hearts and minds of the plain people of the Free World to an awareness of the menace. By its leadership in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, American labor has welded the free trade unions of every nation into a solid front against Communism."

In Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and even some parts of Latin America, ugly tension and unbridled nationalism are mixed up, often in dangerous ways, with hopes and aspirations we all respect. "

Today, the record makes it clear that this has not been done--and circumstances make it certain that it will not be done in the four years ahead. It was not, as some sought to suggest, the habit of the past that sustained your faith in the Democratic party in 1952. It was rather your vision of the future. It is true that Southerners have long memories, and many bitter things to remember.

Our policy, therefore, should be founded on the firm cornerstone of the friendship of the American people for its democratic friend--Israel.

He boasts of tremendous power development during the past eight years, and he asserted that the Russians can overtake us only if we did nothing for fifteen years, while they built eight Grand Coulee Dams a year.  That is his charge and what are the facts?  The facts were reported last year by a committee of the U.S. Senate, over which Mr. Nixon occasionally presides.  That committee's findings, and I quote, were Although the United States is still far ahead, the Russians could overtake us in 1975, in fifteen years, unless we speed up or they slow down.

So I address myself to that problem and I feel very strongly about it.  I think I disagreed with Mr. Nixon on it.  He states that he is satisfied with what we are now doing.  He referred to the term growthmanship, somewhat disparagingly.  I think it is a very important matter, because it goes to the future of our position around the world.  Now the question is what can we do to stimulate our growth."

Mr. Nixon could not run on the program that he runs on if he recognized our times.  He could not run on the program that our power and prestige is at its height, that of the communists at the lowest it has been, that everything is all right and being done in its proper measure.  The very fact that he chooses that as his campaign indicates that he could not suddenly reverse in 1961 and determine on action.  If he really believes these things he says, in my opinion he disqualifies himself.  If he does not believe them, and runs on that program, he makes the same mistake that Stanley Baldwin made in England in 1935 which almost destroyed Great Britain, by misleading the people of England in 1935.  He prevented them, by not telling them the truth, he prevented them from arming at a time when it might have been possible to prevent the disaster of Munich."

The average teacher in America today starts at about $14,000 or $13,000 a year.  In some states it's far less.  I was in Florida a year ago, and I saw a teacher's schedule that showed a teacher who had twenty years of teaching with a doctorate degree made $17,000 a year.  I may be off a couple thousand, but I remember being shocked by the figure.  I have talked to any number of young people who went into teaching full of hope and found out they just couldn't stick with it, couldn't afford it.  I talked to a young man in New Hampshire.  I don't think he voted for me based on the returns, but we had a nice conversation.  He told me that, more than anything, he wanted to be a science teacher.  But he had a family of two kids, he was now thirty-six years of age.  He said, I couldn't do it.  I had to get out.  And I made double or triple whatever it was in the private sector.  What is happening today is that a lot of young, skilled people are not going into education.  The tests show that a disproportionate number are testing at the lowest levels of skills and aptitudes.  That doesn't mean a lot of them won't become good teachers.  We ought to have a society in which both in terms of the environment of teaching being honored as a profession and the pay, is such that the very best, the top of each class, goes into education.  I think last year--as I recall, in Los Angeles--I believe I was told that a beginning teacher there made $13,000 and a beginning policeman $28,000.  I don't begrudge the policeman's salary at all.  But we're saying something about teaching when we give it this low status, and, of course, our kids will pay and our nation will pay.  By now we should know that it is the product of the trained mind that is the greatest source of wealth in America.  It's more important than all of our national resources, everything.  That's from an economic standpoint.  But education, of course--that's why I use the word learning--goes to the basis of our democracy, to our personal enrichment and fulfillment, of our understanding of this ever more dangerous world in which we live.  Education does everything that we need.  And it all begins with what goes on in that classroom.  If it's not effective, if we don't have the best teaching, it's not going to work.  As president, I intend to put a tremendous amount of attention on this.  I've spent a lot of my life in it.  And I don't think there's any other way of getting it done except with presidential leadership."

Above all, our Democratic platform calls for action on the overshadowing problems of war and peace--the most important unfinished business of our generation--and I mean steady resistance to Communism and patient and persistent efforts to build a peace which has been man's dearest goal from time immemorial. Now, in these few words--if these were all that you knew about me and about our Democratic platform, well, I will have to confess that you wouldn't know very much for it is easy to get up here on a campaign train and say some nice sounding words, but out of our party you get a lot more than some high sounding words--you get first of all the record of twenty years of solid accomplishment, of accomplishment in the interests of all our people, and I hope you will compare this record with the Republican record before you vote--for, by the way, they have a record too during these past twenty years, and it is easy to sum up that record. Whenever there has been a forward looking, a constructive program to oppose, they have opposed it, and that is about all their record amounts to."

I ask you: to whom should our people entrust the fight against Communism--to those Old Guard Republicans who, on one issue after another, vote the way our enemies like to see them vote? Or to those who have rallied the free world against Communist aggression?"

But that program of service to the people--of the meeting of the people's needs--is still far from complete. We face the immediate problem of counteracting the inflationary forces which have driven our cost of living up too high. So, we of the Democratic party support a strong and firm policy of direct and indirect cost of living controls, while at the same time the Republicans in Congress vote to punch holes in the price controls, in the tax laws, and to end rent controls completely."

They were merely beautifying the state highway at the access point of the city, where it began to come into the city. And where it had been shabby and ugly and messy they were cleaning it up around there and developing a picnic area--that sort of thing--and an infinite variety of things. Also, of course, from the point of view of the public official, it is a wonderful access point to communities."

I have never felt better; I feel frustrated only by the difficulty I have had in engaging in any genuine debate with the Republicans; and, as far as my sense of humor is concerned, I hope it is intact.

We can win peace in the world without a third world war, but only by dedicating our minds and our hearts, our sweat and our blood to that great task for as long as may be necessary. I tell you that the way to our goal is not easy, but the goal is worth the price, for the goal is nothing less than a nation fair and productive beyond our dreams and a world of law and order where men of good will can live together in equal dignity and under God. This is the future that we seek and this is the future for which I know we are willing to work and to sacrifice and to labor with all of our minds and with all of our hearts, and this is the cause to which we call you.

And one reason for this is that it has become harder and harder instead of easier and easier to tell precisely what the Republican party stands for in this campaign. I confess it is early in the morning to be harsh about anybody and to be very critical of anybody. I don't want to be critical or harsh. I have in mind that we are now only a week from our election and we still don't know precisely what the Republicans propose to do about much of anything. We know where they stand on the matter of a new labor relations law, for example. That is precisely where they stood for the past five years. That is an old Republican position."

That is why one can believe that the importance of bolstering our defenses by the foreign aid programs--Point Four, and things of that kind--are essential if we are going to hope to frustrate the designs of this godless tyranny throughout the world. I thank you so much for affording me this opportunity of participating even briefly in the ceremonies. I count you very fortunate indeed to have this splendid housing development in your neighborhood; and I can add that I am very jealous of it. I should like to be participating in a similar project in Chicago where we too have desperate need of the advantages of public housing."

Many thousands of our votes will come from rank-and-file Republicans who will vote with us. No doubt some Democrats will vote for the Republican candidates.

Lately it seems to be too much in the nation.  We do these things together because no one can do them for himself alone.  We must approach those group problems with a spirit of cooperation, a readiness to accept the responsibilities of each of us which are group in character.  If we do not do that then there comes that creeping tide of central law that finally results in the all-powerful state, and we do it because we are regimented.

It makes certain that every time you come back you think more of this country.  If there is any veteran in this whole crowd who didn't have that same feeling when he came stemming into New York or San Francisco or Seattle or Norfolk, then I would be astonished because I have never yet met one who has not said, Well, one good thing a tour abroad does for you; it makes you understand how well worthwhile it is working here at home."

If we do not stop that kind of thing, ladies and gentlemen, then America cannot be what it has been in the past.  We must have a solvent America, an America that lives within its means, yet so far have they gone with these spendthrift policies that the government itself says that last year every city family had to spend $400 more than that family could earn to pay for its shelter, its food, its clothing and other necessities in the family.

I don't come before you, ladies and gentlemen, to make any long list of promises.  All the promises, the political promises, have been used up in the last 20 years anyway.  What I bring to you is a pledge, a pledge couched in the kind of thing that you people have a right to demand and expect of your government, that if you want to send the leaders of this crusade to Washington; they make this pledge now, they will above all things be honest; they will make it possible for all the agencies of the government that have the task of investigating--to make it possible for them to make their findings open to the public.

Which makes it all the more necessary that we watch with a jaundiced eye anything that is unnecessary--all of the waste, the duplication, the inefficiency that we know about, and which you would not expect me here today at this time to enumerate.  That must be eliminated and it is the second purpose of this crusade."

We will do them ladies and gentlemen only if we are a united people, united behind the great aspirations and purposes of our government.  And right there is the crux of the matter.  You must have a government that you trust, respect and believe in, if you are going to have a united United States.  A united United States would be a strong bulwark of peace.  A united strong United States can lead the free nations of the world into that kind of collective security program that will lift a great burden from our hearts:  the burden of fear abroad."

You give me a chance to look in your faces, to bring you a word of greeting, and to give you one or two of the thoughts that are on my mind as we go through this political campaign.  I have had a wonderful day and a half in your state, starting up at Sacramento.  It seems to me I have been covering ground very rapidly and every place there seems to be a new surprise.  Now, for example, here when the so-called professional politicians began to give me my lessons in this new art a few months back, they told me there was one thing you could not do-go to an airport and address a group of American citizens.  I was told they simply wouldn't come.  So I find out today that at least in Long Beach those political friends of mine were wrong, and I am delighted."

They will be consulted, and not the way they are consulted now:  You do this or you will get no more.  They will be consulted on what is the problem of their locality.

They said I was anti-Catholic, anti-Negro, anti-Semitic, anti-everything.  Well, that one I didn't have to answer, my friends.

He has not hesitated to endorse any Republican, be he a Taft Republican or a McCarthy Republican.

I think we must emphasize the things that unite America.  I pointed out in speaking to a great labor organization yesterday the fact that Mr. Kennedy had been in Detroit and made the statement that he was for everything union leaders were for, in effect, and that he opposed everything that they were against.  And I said to this group, Look, I'm for many of the things your leaders are for, but I'm not for all the things and I will not make a commitment that I'm for all the things that the leaders of unions or management or farm organizations or any other part or group of America are for, because a president must be president of all America and not just part of America."

So, first, because he is a man who understands power and respects it, because he is a man who will use power if he can get away with it, to accomplish his ends, we must make sure that he never believes he is strong enough and that we are weak enough that he could start something without risking national suicide on his own part. And, so, the first necessity of leadership in these critical years ahead is that the United States must continue to be what she is today--the strongest nation in the world.  And, my friends, we must continue to maintain that advantage that we presently have, and the next president must be prepared to ask the American people for whatever was necessary to maintain it because through that strength in our hands, we serve the cause of peace.

On August 25th, the Department of Agriculture, under pressure from consumer and baker's groups, announced that they were lowering the high 47 cents a bushel subsidy. But there was a kicker to that announcement. August 25th, the cut off date, was to last a week.

First of all, the farmer who grew the wheat and sold it at a lower price than would otherwise have been the case had he had the information that was given to these grain traders. Secondly, the taxpayers financed it--not by subsidies to the grain farmers, but to the export subsidies that went to the tune of more than $100 million beyond what could be justified to the great grain exporting companies. And now we read on yesterday that these grain speculators want to crawl through an unjustified loophole in the tax law known as the Disc System that would exempt 50% of these windfall profits from any tax at all. I want to say here that these fellows are not grain sharks--they are hogs. They want it all.

Youngstown was not, in 1932, a pleasant place to work or to live--and Youngstown was typical of most of the cities of America. The steel mills here in the Mahoning Valley were working at 31 percent of capacity. One Youngstown working man out of every three was unemployed. There was no unemployment compensation. The other two men worked at poverty wages. There was no minimum wage law. Those men worked in silence beside the furnaces. There was no collective bargaining act. The foreman's word was law. The working man had no seniority rights in his job and there was almost no collective bargaining contracts; almost no unions. At the end of life's work when you could no longer work, there was nothing. There was no social security. You only knew that one day--and you never knew when--there would be a pink dismissal slip in your envelope, and that would be all. If it was bad at the mill, it was infinitely worse in the street and in the home. Youngstown was one of the first cities to start soup kitchens. So desperate indeed did the city of Youngstown become that the City Council..."

I want to say to you that one of the happiest experiences that I have had in my brief life as a politician has been today in New York state. Not the least of it has been the fact that I have been privileged to travel with one of the most beloved and respected citizens of our generation, your Senator Herbert Lehman of New York."

In fighting Communists at home, I shall rely on such experienced guardians of our security as J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and General Bedell Smith of the Central Intelligence Agency. These men fight Communism as it must be fought--with care, thoroughness, precision--and silence."

I have never felt better; I feel frustrated only by the difficulty I have had in engaging in any genuine debate with the Republicans; and, as far as my sense of humor is concerned, I hope it is intact.

That is why one can believe that the importance of bolstering our defenses by the foreign aid programs--Point Four, and things of that kind--are essential if we are going to hope to frustrate the designs of this godless tyranny throughout the world. I thank you so much for affording me this opportunity of participating even briefly in the ceremonies. I count you very fortunate indeed to have this splendid housing development in your neighborhood; and I can add that I am very jealous of it. I should like to be participating in a similar project in Chicago where we too have desperate need of the advantages of public housing."

Many thousands of our votes will come from rank-and-file Republicans who will vote with us. No doubt some Democrats will vote for the Republican candidates.

This is a brave and a generous country, I think we are bearing our responsibilities well as the strong leader of the free nations against the threat of Soviet communism.  We are doing the hard job that must be done if we are to have a secure place for ourselves and for those children.  We are following out the high ideals of Woodrow Wilson, who wanted to take us our full part--give us our full part--accept our full responsibility for securing the peace back in 1920 after the first World War.  The American people didn't listen to Wilson in those days.  We turned instead to people who led us away from the hard road of international cooperation to the easy  path of isolation.  If we had listened to him we might well have avoided the terrible trial of the second World War, in which 300,000 of our young men died."

If we do not stop that kind of thing, ladies and gentlemen, then America cannot be what it has been in the past.  We must have a solvent America, an America that lives within its means, yet so far have they gone with these spendthrift policies that the government itself says that last year every city family had to spend $400 more than that family could earn to pay for its shelter, its food, its clothing and other necessities in the family.  If that goes on, not only is this government going to be broke but all the families in it are going to be broke.  That is not America."

At times the pitiless pressure of Communism has been checked by brave emergency attempts that rallied men of all parties to make up the deficiencies in our national leadership.  These attempts have produced the economic help of the Marshall Plan and the program of military aid to Greece and Turkey.  Both were enactments of the Republican 80th Congress, the Congress so long vilified by the administration.  These measures have helped to steady both the economic and the nervous systems of our allies.  They could hardly have been expected to do more in the making of our foreign policy.  Dollars and guns are no substitute for brains and willpower."

It is the day that marked the adoption of the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution.  In that Bill of Rights it specifies what are the rights of human beings as opposed to the power of government, the limits of what government can do to the individual today, and those ten amendments, possibly coupled with the organization our forefathers gave us, is the real genius of American government.  When those rights, any one of them, comes in peril from within or any threat from without, it is time for every loyal American, not just the rich, not just the farmers, not just the workmen, but everybody.  It is time for every loyal American to rise up, take a look, gird himself for battle, and fight off the encroachment."

All of us have gone up and down the country pledging not only the extension of those programs, but their correction, to make good the losses you have already suffered through inflation--in your bonds, in your savings accounts and in your pensions--and above all, to save whatever value still remains in the dollar.

Then, as if all of this were not enough, why do we have to have any vestige of subversion or dishonesty in our government--in high places and in low? Not long ago, a lady wrote me a letter.  She said, General, I should like to vote for you, but before I do will you promise me this:  That you will see that more of my tax money actually gets to Washington.

I think we need an administration which so regards it. We spend $42 billion on defense every year. Those ships sail the oceans. They protect us but they do not serve our people and the world. I do not regard the distribution of food around the world as a great burden upon us. I regard it as an opportunity, to use our assets in a way which will attract people to the cause of freedom. I am glad that this is our problem, and not starvation. I am glad we can produce more than we can consume, if we share it usefully, for we are our brother's keeper; and if we have great assets in this country, I believe we should hold out the hand of friendship. When hundreds of millions of people stagger through their lives searching for food and we have it, and we are trying to determine which way the world will go, I would rather see our food used in an imaginative way than to argue in kitchens or anyplace else.

The question is which party and which candidate can meet their problems in this state, and meet their in this country.

I remember when President Truman used to say that the farmers had themselves to blame for their difficulties because they voted Republican in 1952.

In his position paper issued in New York within the last three weeks, he says that the Housing Act of 1949 has worked very well, and do you know as a congressman he voted against it?  In that position paper he called for greater emphasis on middle-income housing and he voted against that in 1950.  He calls for a greater flow of housing credit so that the American people can buy houses at low rates of interest.  But he neglects to mention his vote as vice president to increase the interest rates on the GI housing bans.  High interest rates never built a single home and one of the reasons why we are building 200,000 less homes each year than we should to keep up with our population increase is because of the high interest rate policy of this administration.

The point of the matter is that the Republican party and Mr. Nixon in his fourteen years of association with it have not stood for progress, have not stood for breaking new ground, have not stood for breaking new frontiers, and I believe in the 1960s, if the United States is going to fulfill its potential, if we are going to fulfill the destiny which is in store for us in the sixties, if we are going to be the leader of freedom, we are going to have to move here at home.

Let us at least draw some meaning that is lasting from their martyrdom. As I said here in Los Angeles last night to a large rally in the streets--I have no careful solutions to offer, and nothing that is strikingly new to say. What needs to be said once more all around the world is Let us stop the killing and stop the killing everywhere. Let us stop it here in our own land before we convince our own children that violence is in fact the normal way of life. Let us stop it while we still have the capacity to love one another as human beings--not just the few people right in our neighborhood, our own families and those around us--but people everywhere who, like us, want their years of happiness and life. But if I have anything to say about the course of events in the years ahead, there is one thing, above all else, that I would like to say and do. I would like to make it possible for a child in the Middle East, or anywhere else around this world, to live a full and secure and happy life before that child dies. I want to try to make it possible for that little girl in Vietnam that we saw running into the arms of the camera lens on fire from Napalm to be blessed by the warmth of love rather than the tragedy of war. I want to try and make it possible for people to live as though we really were created in the image of God rather than in the image of our worst fears and suspicions of each other. So I say Peace--not just now, but peace always. I say Peace--not just in one land, but in every land where there are men and women and children who don't know what it is to see a sunrise or to see trees in the springtime. I see and say Peace--on a planet which gives us life, among people who have no right to take it away from others. And I ask, as I did last night, that you say with me, in the words of that great prayer of St. Francis of Assisi, Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. And then we will reap all of the blessings that we, and the generations before us, had hoped for, and our children will bless us because we have given them the fullness of life.

I say let us glory in the service of our sons--and let us honor them by facing squarely and soberly the truth about the world today. This is not just an election to be won by one man or another. Four years of America's future hang in the balance, four historic years of decision, hard decisions."

We take our stand upon the fundamental principle that the role of government is, to sum up, just this: To remove the roadblocks put in the way of the people by nature and by greedy men; to release the energies of the people, so that free men may work the miracles of the future as they have worked the miracles of the past.  No man could travel across our country, as I have done, without being deeply stirred. No man then--his heart touched and his mind moved--could but reflect upon his country's destiny, his love for it the greater as perils encompass it. As we walk through a troubled time, let us remember that the United States was born to greatness. "

Today America is more prosperous than any other nation in history. Of course, the Old Guard orators are going around the country these days broadcasting gloomy warnings that our prosperity is a fake, that it is based on war, that a depression will come with peace. This is nonsense. The truth is that our tremendous defense effort is holding us back, gobbling up the goods our people need at home, and when we have at last won through to safer waters, we shall be able to work at a hundred and one tasks that need doing.

And I hope you will also think hard about what kind of foreign policy you want this country to follow in the years ahead. We face a long, tough, bitter struggle to preserve freedom in the world. We know in our hearts, all of us, that it is childish to suppose there is any simple solution, any easy answer. The lives of our sons are involved now, while we are fighting in Korea. The lives of everyone would be involved if that conflict were to grow into world war."

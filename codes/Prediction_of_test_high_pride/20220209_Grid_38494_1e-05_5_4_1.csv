I want to say to you that one of the happiest experiences that I have had in my brief life as a politician has been today in New York state. Not the least of it has been the fact that I have been privileged to travel with one of the most beloved and respected citizens of our generation, your Senator Herbert Lehman of New York."

I ask you: to whom should our people entrust the fight against Communism--to those Old Guard Republicans who, on one issue after another, vote the way our enemies like to see them vote? Or to those who have rallied the free world against Communist aggression?"

Are these the men we want to lead our nation in the struggle against Communism today? All the while they proclaim ferocious anti-Communism. Indeed, the best way they can apparently find to obscure their retreat from the fight against Communism abroad, the fight to keep it distant from our shores, is by shouting and screaming every hour on the hour about how much they hate Communism at home."

The great transformation which has overtaken our country in these twenty years has come about, in great part, because we have had a new spirit and a new purpose in our government--you could almost feel the change from confusion to confidence, from fear to faith, when the election of 1932 produced a great new leader, Franklin Roosevelt. And that was only the beginning of the process by which America began to lift itself out of the depths, both economically and spiritually, and onto a new plane of social responsibility and of decency. Government assumed responsibilities to avert economic catastrophe and to assure reasonable levels of security for the people. By doing this, great new energies within the people were unlocked. Of course, this new activity on the part of government aroused resentment. The Old Guard began raising their tired old refrain of socialism, and regimentation; you have heard these cries against every new idea in American history since the post office and the public schools."

They are awful keen about this law enforcement, but they continue to use all these devices in their own posts. So it is a little incongruous. They say, By gosh, we are going to clean up crime in this community and get those slot machines out of that corner saloon. But of course, as far as our Legion Post, or VFW, or whatever it is, that belongs to us and it is certainly a different situation. And after all, the device is set to give the fellow at least a sixty to a hundred chance of winning as against one chance in a hundred in the commercial device; and, after all, we own the machine, and it is not owned by a syndicate of operators and placed on a rental basis. And so on and so on."

That is why one can believe that the importance of bolstering our defenses by the foreign aid programs--Point Four, and things of that kind--are essential if we are going to hope to frustrate the designs of this godless tyranny throughout the world. I thank you so much for affording me this opportunity of participating even briefly in the ceremonies. I count you very fortunate indeed to have this splendid housing development in your neighborhood; and I can add that I am very jealous of it. I should like to be participating in a similar project in Chicago where we too have desperate need of the advantages of public housing."

Who gave us the Marshall Plan which prevented the Kremlin's bloodless conquest of Western Europe? Who faced up to the Russians in Berlin when they tried to strangle and seize that city? Who insisted on the heroic airlift and who was it that hammered out the North Atlantic Alliance, which banded together the free people of Europe in a united defense against Communist aggression?"

My first two days were spent in six southern cities. I was interested to see what were the subjects that seemed to interest them most, subjects involving national problems and the national scene, and then to compare those with similar reactions in the north. In my opinion they are identical."

Once we have gotten that thought in our minds so that we never forget it, ladies and gentlemen, we can clean out corruption.  Why, think of it, think of the votes we can roll up on November 4th.  We can bring down taxes; we can stop the terrific taxes that are piling up your prices.  An economist came into me the other day, one of these fellows, you know, that dig out the facts.  Every time you eat a boiled egg, unless you raise it yourself, you pay 100 taxes on that egg, one hundred taxes and then we wonder where the prices come from."

Here is something else we are going to cast out--governmental domination of the people it is supposed to serve.  When I talk about this you may get the idea that I am trying to be philosophical or highbrow, but believe me, this thing affects the lives of every one of us.  Like the rest of the things we will cast out, this too is a product of fear and lack of faith in the people.  This idea that government is the people's master is widespread in our world.  It is called by many names, but it always leads to the same destination.  It puts the gears of progress in reverse and carries society back to the days when the king was government and government was the final goal and the only power."

I think that the administration in Washington has gone too far in damaging, indeed leading toward destruction of the kind of America we have known, loved and believe in.  That administration has not led us intelligently toward peace.  It is spending more than it earns.  Indeed, it earns nothing.  It is spending more than it takes from us in the highest taxes we have ever had, and leaves a deficit in the budget that further cheapens our money."

At times the pitiless pressure of Communism has been checked by brave emergency attempts that rallied men of all parties to make up the deficiencies in our national leadership.  These attempts have produced the economic help of the Marshall Plan and the program of military aid to Greece and Turkey.  Both were enactments of the Republican 80th Congress, the Congress so long vilified by the administration.  These measures have helped to steady both the economic and the nervous systems of our allies.  They could hardly have been expected to do more in the making of our foreign policy.  Dollars and guns are no substitute for brains and willpower."

We stopped the shooting war in 1945 the strongest military nation in the world, to say nothing of our academic strength and our spiritual, intellectual, scientific and moral strength.  We were the greatest military nation on the globe."

What I am discussing as I go around is the incompetent leadership you have gotten over the past seven years from your administration in Washington.  And I go into the various subjects of our lack of progress toward peace, our excessive expenditures on the federal level, the deficits that are cheapening our money, the crises that are going up, the taxes that grow more and more burdensome; and, with all of the necessary expenditures for defense organisms that we must have, still a kind of incompetence in government that gets two airfields in North Africa for the price of five and the kind of thing going on in the Justice Department that led an ex-under secretary, a high official in the Justice Department, to say only yesterday, Why, if my ex-chief should tell all he knew, they would blow the White House so high that the power of gravity could not bring it back."

I was told that the last stop at Grand Rapids, Now, this is where you say goodbye to Michigan.  And then as we came along, a couple of your finest salesmen from Kalamazoo said, We are going to slow up the train as you go through Kalamazoo and you wave at some people.  Then later they said, Now, we'll tell you what we want to do.  We'll stop there a second and you just go on out and say hello and go on with your work.  I'll tell you this; it's a funny kind of a slowing down and a funny kind of a way to a little neighborhood crowd.  I am completely flabbergasted and I am certainly honored."

Well, some things are so false you don't know the right words to use, at least in polite society, for condemning them.  I went to Kasson and on behalf of Republican leaders, and with the concurrence of the great men of the party, at least all that could be reached in time, I stated exactly what we meant to do, and the present 90 percent parity price in the farm program was sustained and supported completely.  Moreover, we pledge that these programs in the future, as it comes time for them to be revised and brought up to date as all programs must be, it will be farmers that will be brought in to Washington whose counsel and advice will not only be sought but, it will be heed."

Nine of them have been relieved for malfeasance or for cheating, or for something else wrong.  Some are behind bars--not long enough--but they are there because they lined their pockets with your money.  That has got to stop.  That is one thing that you don't have to stand for. "

There can be no peace in this world until there is a strong America leading us toward peace--strong spiritually, economically, financially, and finally militarily. We are going to have that kind of strength only if we are united behind a government that excites our pride.  Such a government will have great prestige abroad; the free countries will want to join with us in establishing a collective security."

By this I mean the actual cost in dollars is something that you have to add onto all these wasteful and extravagant expenses, as well as the necessary expenses.  But the great damage done to us by corruption in government is, after all, not just the few dollars it takes out of our tax revenues and our pockets.  This mess in Washington lowers our prestige abroad and robs us of pride in our own government.  If we are going to restore pride in government, who is going to do it?  You can't take an organization that has been in power far too long and merely by doing a little face-lifting job, doing a little repaint job, get by with it.  Actually, I believe that the administration candidate said all it needed was a little refreshening.  But as far as I am concerned, how do you refreshen a bad egg?"

They will be consulted, and not the way they are consulted now:  You do this or you will get no more.  They will be consulted on what is the problem of their locality.  We have no intention in this crusade of getting a bunch of long-haired Brannan experts to come out and run your farms.  We figure you can do it a little better."

Now, there are obviously many things that Washington must come in and help if we are going to develop this great West the way it must be developed--and that means to the limit of its capacity to absorb development--but when they do come in, the federal government must come in as a partner; they must take seriously and earnestly the advice and the counsel of the people who are on the spot, and if we don't do that the West will never be developed as it should be. The crusade upon which we are now embarked has that as one of its purposes--in every section, to pay respect, to give due influence to the knowledge and information that local people have on their own problems and not try to do these things from Washington."

I haven't anything in shopworn promises to offer you, but I do tell you this:  When this campaign started and we had some smoothly flowing, high sounding language from the opposition as to what they were going to do--I made a pledge."

No agency, public or private, has been more effective in arousing the hearts and minds of the plain people of the Free World to an awareness of the menace. By its leadership in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, American labor has welded the free trade unions of every nation into a solid front against Communism."

Today, the record makes it clear that this has not been done--and circumstances make it certain that it will not be done in the four years ahead. It was not, as some sought to suggest, the habit of the past that sustained your faith in the Democratic party in 1952. It was rather your vision of the future. It is true that Southerners have long memories, and many bitter things to remember. But it is also true that the South is caught up today in a rushing pattern of change that makes this in many ways the most exciting and the most promising region in our country."

Just because this administration has not been able to make any progress toward safe disarmament or even toward controlling H-bomb development, does not mean that such agreements are forever impossible.

I suggest that, if I were anxious to win the confidence of the American people and remembering the Washington mess of only four years ago--there is one word that is the last that I would take from out the whole dictionary to use in a political argument--and that word is corruption. When this word is uttered in any political hall of the opposition, it echoes with a most curious ring. I know why, for I recall an old but grim proverb.

Fourth, we must appoint a Federal Power Commission that represents the public interest and not the private interest. Therefore, in the 1960s we need a whole new concept of resource development. So vast, so complex, and so essential are our natural resources that they cannot be parceled out piecemeal; nothing less than a comprehensive, basin-by-basin, valley-by-valley development of our natural resources, to make sure that not one drop of our water goes from the wellsprings of our water to the sea without being used for a public purpose."

This train is headed not only south, but it is headed toward Washington.

In that time, as you recall, the great issue was whether this country could stay united, whether it would, in the words of Lincoln, exist half slave and half free.  The issue in the election of 1960 involves not only the well-being of the people of this valley, involves not only the development of your natural resources, but as citizens of the United States and leaders of the free world, we must be concerned about such far-off places as the Congo, India, and Indonesia, the security of those countries, as well as the well-being of their people.

Unless this country moves ahead, unless we continue to grow, unless our defenses are strong, unless we're educating our children, unless we are showing in every way, in science, in space, and here in Texas, that this country is first, not to follow when or where, but first--and that's what the Democratic party wants to do in the 1960s."

Other Democratic presidents in this country--Woodrow Wilson, who served in this city, in this state, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman--all faced difficult and dangerous times.

I spoke this afternoon at the plowing contest on what I consider to be the number one domestic problem which the United States faces, and that is the sharp decline in agricultural income. I think the farmers of North Dakota and the farmers of South Dakota and of Minnesota and Montana have a very clear choice. The question is which party and which candidate can meet their problems in this state, and meet their in this country. They have heard from the Democratic party and they have heard from the Republican party. I remember when President Truman used to say that the farmers had themselves to blame for their difficulties because they voted Republican in 1952.

I want an America that is not first, if; not first, but; not first, when; but first, period, and I think we can do it.  I believe that this generation of Americans has the same rendezvous with destiny as that generation of Americans in 1936 to whom Franklin Roosevelt addressed those words, that that generation had a rendezvous with destiny.

My judgment is that there is a very clear choice between the Republican and the Democratic parties.  They stand for different things, and they have stood for different things all through this century.  Woodrow Wilson, running in 1912, said that the Republican party idea of policy is to sit on the lid.  Franklin Roosevelt carried the fight in 1932 and 1936 and Harry Truman carried the fight in 1948, and on the issues which matter, housing, social security, medical care for the aged, minimum wage, development of the resources of this country, I believe the Democratic party looks forward.

Roosevelt, who was running in 1920 for the vice presidency of the United States, with Governor Cox of Ohio.  Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt then journeyed to Washington, D.C., and went to see Woodrow Wilson, sick, aging, and at the end of his career.  After Woodrow Wilson talked for a few minutes however, with great feeling and great fire of his desire for a unified world and a world of peace, Governor Cox broke in and said, We are behind you 100 percent, and they fought that campaign in part to implement the ideal of Woodrow Wilson for the establishment of the League of Nations, and lost.  But Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt, in losing that election in 1920, held before themselves and the people their concept of the service that they can render in an election, of attempting to turn the attention of the people to the great issues that face us, and the great possibilities that lie in action in the future.  And I believe in this election 40 years later, we merely do not run for office, but we also seek to establish a basic point, that what this country is now doing is not good enough, that in the 1960s, if we are going to maintain our freedom, if we are going to meet our commitments at home and abroad, we have to do better, and that is the basic issue which has separated Mr. Nixon and myself.

Now, as the market price drops so drops the support price.  Where you had $1.50 for corn eight years ago, you may be getting 90 cents for corn today, or 93 cents.  That is the market price.  Mr. Nixon will pay you 90 percent of that market price next year, and if it drops to 85 cents, he will pay you 90 percent of that, and that is the step, down, down, down, until farmers are driven off their farms in increasing numbers."

But what is the area of difference between us?  What is the issue on which you should base your decision?  You should not only make a judgment of Mr. Nixon and myself.  You should also make a judgment about yourselves, what you want, about what your view is of your country and your community, about what your view of the future is, whether you are satisfied today or wish to do better.  If you are satisfied, if you feel happy about your life, if you feel our country is meeting its responsibilities, then you belong in Mr. Nixon's camp.  But if you share the view that I hold very vigorously that this country is going to have to do better in the future, that we have responsibilities to meet not only to ourselves but to the cause of freedom, that we are anxious to make sure that in the future people decide that these days were great days in the life of our country, that we must move forward, we must stimulate our growth, we must hold out an image to the world of a vigorous, dynamic society, if we are going to continue to lead the free world--I believe that is the choice.

And I said to this group, Look, I'm for many of the things your leaders are for, but I'm not for all the things and I will not make a commitment that I'm for all the things that the leaders of unions or management or farm organizations or any other part or group of America are for, because a president must be president of all America and not just part of America."

Not by those who should have loved her, but by others. The first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, who began bringing extra food. The woman whose house she went to work in who knew that my mother wanted to go to high school. She would have been a freshman in high school when she had to leave her grandparents' home and she got this job. And that woman said, I know you want to go to high school. If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school, but you'll have to come back because we'll need you in the late afternoon."

For nearly four decades we have marched together in this country for the same goal:  a safer, a better, a more prosperous and a freer America and Americans, an America of equal opportunity where every individual can say not in defiance but in pride, I am an American and I am a man and I am proud to be a citizen of this great country.  Yes, yes, we march, we marched for Franklin Roosevelt out of the dark days of the Depression when he said that all we had to fear was fear itself and we marched right on through that Depression and America went on to win a great victory not only over a Depression, but in World War II and we marched with Harry Truman, who told it just like it was and he did something about it, too, for all of us, and we marched and we marched with John F. Kennedy who stood before you eight years ago and said these words to you:  I would like it to be said that in our administration, our country moved, but special emphasis on education, took care of our children and gave medical care to the aged and that we ended discrimination of all kinds in the United States.  He said, and I say, we want fair treatment for all Americans.  that is the Democratic program.  And, my friends, we have been marching to that  music, to Democratic administrations, and we passed Medicare and more aid to education to help our children than any other administration in the history of this country and we passed more civil rights legislation and we have done more for our job training and more opportunity than any political party or any administration.  That's why we are proud to be Democrats.  And you can tell your grandchildren that you were there when America awoke from eight years of fitful sleep, the great GOP slumber, and moved forward once again under Kennedy, under Johnson, and now under Humphrey and Muskie.  Yes, Mr. Nixon says, and now listen to what he says, because really it's hard to understand what he says.  It's a little confusing.  Listen to what he says.

It can be helped in a way that is natural to us and best for it; help in the ways of peace and of social progress. India has to grow more food. It has to restore its land. It needs new resources of power. In short, it needs a democratic helping hand in the development programs it has already charted for itself."

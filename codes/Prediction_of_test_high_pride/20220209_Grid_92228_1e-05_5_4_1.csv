Youngstown was not, in 1932, a pleasant place to work or to live--and Youngstown was typical of most of the cities of America. The steel mills here in the Mahoning Valley were working at 31 percent of capacity. One Youngstown working man out of every three was unemployed. There was no unemployment compensation. The other two men worked at poverty wages. There was no minimum wage law. Those men worked in silence beside the furnaces. There was no collective bargaining act. The foreman's word was law. The working man had no seniority rights in his job and there was almost no collective bargaining contracts; almost no unions. At the end of life's work when you could no longer work, there was nothing. There was no social security. You only knew that one day--and you never knew when--there would be a pink dismissal slip in your envelope, and that would be all. If it was bad at the mill, it was infinitely worse in the street and in the home. Youngstown was one of the first cities to start soup kitchens. So desperate indeed did the city of Youngstown become that the City Council..."

I want to say to you that one of the happiest experiences that I have had in my brief life as a politician has been today in New York state. Not the least of it has been the fact that I have been privileged to travel with one of the most beloved and respected citizens of our generation, your Senator Herbert Lehman of New York."

I think we must sweep out of the corridors of government, at all levels, national and state, those lingering suspicions which are a holdover from an earlier and very different time.  This is a problem which concerns me very deeply, for I am convinced that both government and business must learn to live together in harmony, before an era of bad temper turns into something infinitely worse. We must avoid at all costs the bitter struggle of class against class, which results inevitably in a drift either to the extreme left or to the extreme right. And you and I know that either kind of drift would end up at the same dreadful destination: a police state with all of the horrors that we have seen in Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia. "

My first two days were spent in six southern cities. I was interested to see what were the subjects that seemed to interest them most, subjects involving national problems and the national scene, and then to compare those with similar reactions in the north. In my opinion they are identical."

A little sergeant--Sergeant Kuhlen--I will never forget his name as long as I live--came up with an idea.  He found that he could put some knives on the front of our tanks that would go in and cut off these hedges.  The tanks could come through straight and come through shooting, and it wasn't very pleasant for the Germans. "

You people pitched in on your own.  You didn't even wait for a Washington bureaucrat to come down and do it.  You did it yourselves.

If we do not stop that kind of thing, ladies and gentlemen, then America cannot be what it has been in the past.  We must have a solvent America, an America that lives within its means, yet so far have they gone with these spendthrift policies that the government itself says that last year every city family had to spend $400 more than that family could earn to pay for its shelter, its food, its clothing and other necessities in the family.  If that goes on, not only is this government going to be broke but all the families in it are going to be broke.  That is not America."

But what the Democratic nominee confessed was that under the present administration policy the American taxpayer is dancing to the Soviet tune and not getting for his tax dollar a clear, coherent plan to do away with the menace of war.  The telltale wording of that statement reflects the surrender of initiative to the Communists."

Measures to deceive them worked so effectively that they estimated our original strength in Europe at seventy-five divisions instead of the actual thirty-six. In the entire American record in Europe there is no single instance where the enemy gained essential information of our plans through the medium of spies or subversive agents."

We will do them ladies and gentlemen only if we are a united people, united behind the great aspirations and purposes of our government.  And right there is the crux of the matter.  You must have a government that you trust, respect and believe in, if you are going to have a united United States.  A united United States would be a strong bulwark of peace.  A united strong United States can lead the free nations of the world into that kind of collective security program that will lift a great burden from our hearts:  the burden of fear abroad."

They will be consulted, and not the way they are consulted now:  You do this or you will get no more.  They will be consulted on what is the problem of their locality.

Then, as if all of this were not enough, why do we have to have any vestige of subversion or dishonesty in our government--in high places and in low? Not long ago, a lady wrote me a letter.  She said, General, I should like to vote for you, but before I do will you promise me this:  That you will see that more of my tax money actually gets to Washington.  I wrote to her and said, My friend, a hard-working American taxpayer does not have to request that common woodshed honesty be observed by American officials in high positions.  That we can and should demand, and we don't have to ask for it."

This party in power in the last seven years has used up every possible political promise there is, and some of them have gotten pretty shopworn.  For example, there is no easier way to duck an issue than to say this, I will promise you a law, well knowing they cannot deliver it.  There is no easier way to get out of a situation.  What I promise you is work, never ending work, to make certain that justice is done.  So I cannot come before you with the competition of promises, but I do come before you with a pledge, and this is the pledge.  If you want to put this crusade at the helm of your government; if you want to substitute for these 22 caliber men who are trying to hold 45 caliber jobs the finest men and women that we can draw from all sections of this country, from every walk of life--and let me say plainly, based upon merit and without respect to color or creed; if you want to have a government of that kind, then you belong in this crusade."

No agency, public or private, has been more effective in arousing the hearts and minds of the plain people of the Free World to an awareness of the menace. By its leadership in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, American labor has welded the free trade unions of every nation into a solid front against Communism."

That was when he said, on October 30, 1953, that he favored the election of every Republican over every Democrat for every office any place. And that is the course he has pursued ever since. He has not hesitated to endorse any Republican, be he a Taft Republican or a McCarthy Republican. The only notable exception was an Eisenhower Republican--Senator Wiley of Wisconsin, for whom the President didn't lift a finger. It used to be said that Mr. Eisenhower would reshape the Republican party. You cannot help but wonder today who has reshaped whom."

The private power companies--surely among the most active critics of governmental activity--have no objection to the billions of dollars worth of government financed and directed research, experiment, and pioneer construction which is being made available free to the private builders of atomic power plants.

Those of Polish and Eastern European origin will remember particularly how the Republican orators--how Secretary of State Dulles--talked about liberation four years ago. This talk of liberation also had only one purpose. It was to win votes from the gullible by creating hopes of rescuing friends and relatives who lived behind the Iron Curtain. And they know now how cynical and empty that talk was. Instead of liberating anyone, four years later half of Indochina is gone and Soviet influence is spreading even in the political and economic field."

First of all, we must rededicate ourselves to our faith in democracy and make that faith a living principle. In the Middle East, Israel is a beacon of democratic faith and of twentieth century progress. Our policy, therefore, should be founded on the firm cornerstone of the friendship of the American people for its democratic friend--Israel. For three years we have tried the ignoble, expedient policy of isolating Israel and trying to buy the friendship of dictators. Colonel Nasser has given us his answer.

The House of Representatives is Democratic by a wide margin, and I doubt that the Democrats in the House of Representatives will lose control. Therefore, the prospect of four or eight years of a divided government, a government manned by a highly partisan figure, manned by a highly partisan party in the executive branch, and we have seen evidence of it in the last few days--how can we hope, at a time when we need action, how can we hope to possibly move ahead when on the one hand we say yes with the Democrats, and on the other hand we say no with the Republicans?

The point of the matter is that the Republican party and Mr. Nixon in his fourteen years of association with it have not stood for progress, have not stood for breaking new ground, have not stood for breaking new frontiers, and I believe in the 1960s, if the United States is going to fulfill its potential, if we are going to fulfill the destiny which is in store for us in the sixties, if we are going to be the leader of freedom, we are going to have to move here at home.

The average teacher in America today starts at about $14,000 or $13,000 a year.  In some states it's far less.  I was in Florida a year ago, and I saw a teacher's schedule that showed a teacher who had twenty years of teaching with a doctorate degree made $17,000 a year.  I may be off a couple thousand, but I remember being shocked by the figure.  I have talked to any number of young people who went into teaching full of hope and found out they just couldn't stick with it, couldn't afford it.  I talked to a young man in New Hampshire.  I don't think he voted for me based on the returns, but we had a nice conversation.  He told me that, more than anything, he wanted to be a science teacher.  But he had a family of two kids, he was now thirty-six years of age.  He said, I couldn't do it.  I had to get out.  And I made double or triple whatever it was in the private sector.  What is happening today is that a lot of young, skilled people are not going into education.  The tests show that a disproportionate number are testing at the lowest levels of skills and aptitudes.  That doesn't mean a lot of them won't become good teachers.  We ought to have a society in which both in terms of the environment of teaching being honored as a profession and the pay, is such that the very best, the top of each class, goes into education.  I think last year--as I recall, in Los Angeles--I believe I was told that a beginning teacher there made $13,000 and a beginning policeman $28,000.  I don't begrudge the policeman's salary at all.  But we're saying something about teaching when we give it this low status, and, of course, our kids will pay and our nation will pay.  By now we should know that it is the product of the trained mind that is the greatest source of wealth in America.  It's more important than all of our national resources, everything.  That's from an economic standpoint.  But education, of course--that's why I use the word learning--goes to the basis of our democracy, to our personal enrichment and fulfillment, of our understanding of this ever more dangerous world in which we live.  Education does everything that we need.  And it all begins with what goes on in that classroom.  If it's not effective, if we don't have the best teaching, it's not going to work.  As president, I intend to put a tremendous amount of attention on this.  I've spent a lot of my life in it.  And I don't think there's any other way of getting it done except with presidential leadership."

The other side trusts the government. We trust the people who are here today. And I want Steve and John and Rob and Jim Bunning and all the--and Mike DeWine, of course, there next year to help me.

You should be proud of the vote you cast for whatever office, for whatever office. And these things do matter to our citizens, particularly young people, who can only make informed choices in an election when there is some connection between the rhetoric and the reality between words and action, between promise and performance. And I think in this case, in this administration, that connection was broken a long time ago."

And I hope and pray, as you all do, that we can conduct our deliberations with a businesslike precision and a dignity befitting our responsibility, and the solemnity of the hour of history in which we meet. For it is a very solemn hour indeed, freighted with the hopes and fears of millions of mankind who see in us, the Democratic Party, sober understanding of the breadth and depth of the revolutionary currents in the world. Here and abroad they see in us awareness that there is no turning back, that, as Justice Holmes said, We must sail sometimes with the wind, sometimes against it; but we must sail and not drift or lie at anchor. They see in us, the Democratic Party that has steered this country through a storm of spears for twenty years, an understanding of a world in the torment of transition from an age that has died to an age struggling to be born. They see in us relentless determination to stand fast against the barbarian at the gate, to cultivate allies with a decent respect for the opinion of others, to patiently explore every misty path to peace and security, which is the only certainty of lower taxes and a better life."

He stood for the things I think are right. He stood for them in the way that was right. I think of him particularly today because he retained--as mayor, governor, attorney general and supreme court justice--the humility which is all too rare a quality among democracy's leaders. He never, even from the heights of public service he reached, looked down on people. He always looked up to them. Recalling what Frank Murphy stood for is about the best advice a candidate for the presidency could give himself on Labor Day of this election year."

There should be no wistful dragging of the feet or turning backward to a dead, irrelevant past.  Government should be competent. Its personnel must not be under the heavy hand of purely political selection or influence. It must not be afraid of raising and spending money for worthy purposes, but it must detest and fear waste and dishonesty as ever present threats to the whole moral basis of government by the consent of the governed because people don't consent voluntarily to be cheated or abused.

It gives large scale application to the principle that flood control must begin at the top of the hill where the first trickle of water starts. It is the most important and hopeful attempt thus far made to reduce the crest of floods by holding back more water on the uplands where it falls and by retarding runoff of the remainder. From Virginia to California, from Iowa to Texas, I have seen evidence of America's need for flood control and soil conservation. This is one of the battles that must go forward if we are to build in the United States the fair and fruitful land of our dreams."

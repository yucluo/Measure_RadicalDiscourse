The great transformation which has overtaken our country in these twenty years has come about, in great part, because we have had a new spirit and a new purpose in our government--you could almost feel the change from confusion to confidence, from fear to faith, when the election of 1932 produced a great new leader, Franklin Roosevelt. And that was only the beginning of the process by which America began to lift itself out of the depths, both economically and spiritually, and onto a new plane of social responsibility and of decency. Government assumed responsibilities to avert economic catastrophe and to assure reasonable levels of security for the people. By doing this, great new energies within the people were unlocked. Of course, this new activity on the part of government aroused resentment. The Old Guard began raising their tired old refrain of socialism, and regimentation; you have heard these cries against every new idea in American history since the post office and the public schools."

Each needs a special sort of ministry. Let us remember that, while Christ preached the doctrine of eternal salvation, he also did the work that needed to be done in the kingdom of man. He healed the sick, fed the poor, sustained the weak, and sheltered all those who were in want. So must we, I think, as Americans continue prudently to extend to the needy of this earth that material help which we almost alone can give. And we ought to do this not grudgingly, but with a clear recognition that it is far better to give than to receive. In a word, the first answer to Communism is not a lesser, but a fuller application of Judaic- Christian ethics to the neighborhood of nations around us."

We can win peace in the world without a third world war, but only by dedicating our minds and our hearts, our sweat and our blood to that great task for as long as may be necessary. I tell you that the way to our goal is not easy, but the goal is worth the price, for the goal is nothing less than a nation fair and productive beyond our dreams and a world of law and order where men of good will can live together in equal dignity and under God. This is the future that we seek and this is the future for which I know we are willing to work and to sacrifice and to labor with all of our minds and with all of our hearts, and this is the cause to which we call you. We don't call it a crusade--we just call it, Forward with America."

That is why one can believe that the importance of bolstering our defenses by the foreign aid programs--Point Four, and things of that kind--are essential if we are going to hope to frustrate the designs of this godless tyranny throughout the world. I thank you so much for affording me this opportunity of participating even briefly in the ceremonies. I count you very fortunate indeed to have this splendid housing development in your neighborhood; and I can add that I am very jealous of it.

Many thousands of our votes will come from rank-and-file Republicans who will vote with us. No doubt some Democrats will vote for the Republican candidates.

This is a brave and a generous country, I think we are bearing our responsibilities well as the strong leader of the free nations against the threat of Soviet communism.  We are doing the hard job that must be done if we are to have a secure place for ourselves and for those children.  We are following out the high ideals of Woodrow Wilson, who wanted to take us our full part--give us our full part--accept our full responsibility for securing the peace back in 1920 after the first World War.  The American people didn't listen to Wilson in those days.  We turned instead to people who led us away from the hard road of international cooperation to the easy  path of isolation.  If we had listened to him we might well have avoided the terrible trial of the second World War, in which 300,000 of our young men died."

It is a record of opposition and harassment for 20 years, not only on price supports, but on all of the other Democratic programs on the storage program, rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, rural electric coops and so on.  The Republican Old Guard has never understood the philosophy behind these programs; it has never understood the programs themselves; it has never understood how they work.  The warning is plain; the Old Guard is hoping that the General can make his easy promises to farmers so convincing that they will forget about their own voting record."

At times the pitiless pressure of Communism has been checked by brave emergency attempts that rallied men of all parties to make up the deficiencies in our national leadership.  These attempts have produced the economic help of the Marshall Plan and the program of military aid to Greece and Turkey.  Both were enactments of the Republican 80th Congress, the Congress so long vilified by the administration.  These measures have helped to steady both the economic and the nervous systems of our allies.  They could hardly have been expected to do more in the making of our foreign policy.

What I am discussing as I go around is the incompetent leadership you have gotten over the past seven years from your administration in Washington.  And I go into the various subjects of our lack of progress toward peace, our excessive expenditures on the federal level, the deficits that are cheapening our money, the crises that are going up, the taxes that grow more and more burdensome; and, with all of the necessary expenditures for defense organisms that we must have, still a kind of incompetence in government that gets two airfields in North Africa for the price of five and the kind of thing going on in the Justice Department that led an ex-under secretary, a high official in the Justice Department, to say only yesterday, Why, if my ex-chief should tell all he knew, they would blow the White House so high that the power of gravity could not bring it back."

Sheer bunk!  What the Republicans have said is this:  our purpose is to keep the dollar from going down further so that there will be no further erosion of your savings account, of your bank account, of your insurance policy and of your bonds.  But instead of seeing those things go down the drain of inflation you will keep them, and moreover they have said that where inflation has already overtaken some of these things, these amounts, and they have gone down below decency, that must be corrected, which means corrected upward.  They have also pledged in their platform to expand social security to go to classes not so far covered."

Well, some things are so false you don't know the right words to use, at least in polite society, for condemning them.  I went to Kasson and on behalf of Republican leaders, and with the concurrence of the great men of the party, at least all that could be reached in time, I stated exactly what we meant to do, and the present 90 percent parity price in the farm program was sustained and supported completely.  Moreover, we pledge that these programs in the future, as it comes time for them to be revised and brought up to date as all programs must be, it will be farmers that will be brought in to Washington whose counsel and advice will not only be sought but, it will be heed."

Another of those blanks is that the Republican leaders would like to abolish all the gains that labor has made through these last years since the beginning of the century.  Ladies and gentlemen, sheer bunk!  I am not going to take time this morning to outline what the Republican Party is attempting to do in establishing the kind of climate in Washington where the labor-management problems can be settled without strikes, but I am going to repeat just briefly the promise I made to labor on Labor Day.  I said something to this effect: that four years from now, if you people had decided this fall to establish a Republican administration in Washington in the Executive Department, in the Senate of the United States, and in the Congress, that the leaders of that group would hope to stand before a crowd like this at the end of those four years, and each of you could look at the other and honestly say, Those people were fair; they were just; they settled everything on the basis of what is good for the United States of America, not just some particular section or group whose votes they were trying to buy--what was good for the United States of America.  Moreover, they would say and you would say to each other, They protected the rights of all--labor, management, professional men, farmers, everyone.  And finally, you would say, And besides being fair and just, they were friendly.  They were just people who belonged to us, one of us, not a bunch of long-haired bureaucrats in Washington who wanted to rule our lives from 3,000 miles away.  That was the pledge I made and I make it everywhere I go."

The first thing I find is a wash-rag and it says, Clean up with Ike. I have got, of course, many, many reasons for being pleased when I get out into this country.  Ever since 1919, friends of mine have been asking me out to fish and hunt, and it has been a grand country, but of course, I don't much chance, so I spend a great deal of time reading western stories.  One of the first ones I ever read was written right around here in this country.  I think it was written in Medicine Bow, Owen Wister's The Virginian."

Then, as if all of this were not enough, why do we have to have any vestige of subversion or dishonesty in our government--in high places and in low? Not long ago, a lady wrote me a letter.  She said, General, I should like to vote for you, but before I do will you promise me this:  That you will see that more of my tax money actually gets to Washington.  I wrote to her and said, My friend, a hard-working American taxpayer does not have to request that common woodshed honesty be observed by American officials in high positions.

And now we come to another glaring example of our national leadership's failure to live up to high ideals.  I refer to the McCarran Immigration Law, which was passed over the president's veto at the last session of Congress.  A new immigration law was certainly needed.  But with leadership, rather than vetoes, we should have had, and we must get, a better law than this McCarran Act."

It was a very, very wonderful promise.  I sincerely appreciated it, but what has happened?  If you are going to educate, you have to start with the record, with the facts.

Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt then journeyed to Washington, D.C., and went to see Woodrow Wilson, sick, aging, and at the end of his career.  After Woodrow Wilson talked for a few minutes however, with great feeling and great fire of his desire for a unified world and a world of peace, Governor Cox broke in and said, We are behind you 100 percent, and they fought that campaign in part to implement the ideal of Woodrow Wilson for the establishment of the League of Nations, and lost.  But Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt, in losing that election in 1920, held before themselves and the people their concept of the service that they can render in an election, of attempting to turn the attention of the people to the great issues that face us, and the great possibilities that lie in action in the future.  And I believe in this election 40 years later, we merely do not run for office, but we also seek to establish a basic point, that what this country is now doing is not good enough, that in the 1960s, if we are going to maintain our freedom, if we are going to meet our commitments at home and abroad, we have to do better, and that is the basic issue which has separated Mr. Nixon and myself.

Mr. Nixon could not run on the program that he runs on if he recognized our times.  He could not run on the program that our power and prestige is at its height, that of the communists at the lowest it has been, that everything is all right and being done in its proper measure.  The very fact that he chooses that as his campaign indicates that he could not suddenly reverse in 1961 and determine on action.  If he really believes these things he says, in my opinion he disqualifies himself.  If he does not believe them, and runs on that program, he makes the same mistake that Stanley Baldwin made in England in 1935 which almost destroyed Great Britain, by misleading the people of England in 1935.  He prevented them, by not telling them the truth, he prevented them from arming at a time when it might have been possible to prevent the disaster of Munich."

But if you share the view that I hold very vigorously that this country is going to have to do better in the future, that we have responsibilities to meet not only to ourselves but to the cause of freedom, that we are anxious to make sure that in the future people decide that these days were great days in the life of our country, that we must move forward, we must stimulate our growth, we must hold out an image to the world of a vigorous, dynamic society, if we are going to continue to lead the free world--I believe that is the choice.

The average teacher in America today starts at about $14,000 or $13,000 a year.  In some states it's far less.  I was in Florida a year ago, and I saw a teacher's schedule that showed a teacher who had twenty years of teaching with a doctorate degree made $17,000 a year.  I may be off a couple thousand, but I remember being shocked by the figure.  I have talked to any number of young people who went into teaching full of hope and found out they just couldn't stick with it, couldn't afford it.  I talked to a young man in New Hampshire.  I don't think he voted for me based on the returns, but we had a nice conversation.  He told me that, more than anything, he wanted to be a science teacher.  But he had a family of two kids, he was now thirty-six years of age.  He said, I couldn't do it.  I had to get out.  And I made double or triple whatever it was in the private sector.  What is happening today is that a lot of young, skilled people are not going into education.  The tests show that a disproportionate number are testing at the lowest levels of skills and aptitudes.  That doesn't mean a lot of them won't become good teachers.  We ought to have a society in which both in terms of the environment of teaching being honored as a profession and the pay, is such that the very best, the top of each class, goes into education.  I think last year--as I recall, in Los Angeles--I believe I was told that a beginning teacher there made $13,000 and a beginning policeman $28,000.  I don't begrudge the policeman's salary at all.  But we're saying something about teaching when we give it this low status, and, of course, our kids will pay and our nation will pay.  By now we should know that it is the product of the trained mind that is the greatest source of wealth in America.  It's more important than all of our national resources, everything.  That's from an economic standpoint.  But education, of course--that's why I use the word learning--goes to the basis of our democracy, to our personal enrichment and fulfillment, of our understanding of this ever more dangerous world in which we live.  Education does everything that we need.  And it all begins with what goes on in that classroom.  If it's not effective, if we don't have the best teaching, it's not going to work.  As president, I intend to put a tremendous amount of attention on this.  I've spent a lot of my life in it.

That was just two months before the start of the best recovery in postwar history. That's why, when I hear some of the projections they make for what it's going to be like in 1989--they're blowing smoke. They don't know what it's going to be like in 1989. It all adds up to a simple lesson: Don't trust the professional pessimists. Trust the American people."

We began to do it for them, and it worked. It worked in two ways. In the first place, it did the job because when they made the raids they could only be effective, of course, against visible objects under the law--slot machines, gambling devices, and bookies, and things like that.

If you take an average worker with three dependents and you calculate his weekly earnings and his taxes and the change in the cost of living, he and his family are $9.84 a week better off than they were in January 1961 when John F. Kennedy became president. What does that mean? That is an 11.8 percent increase, really 12 percent increase, in these last forty-four months. And then if you look at what happened to that same average worker during the preceding forty-four months, he had a gain during that period of $1.31, or only 1.7 percent compared to 12 percent. You know which administration is best for you--1.7, less than 2 percent, compared to 12 percent, 6 to 1.

21549,2382,"CARTER. In the first place, we have to remember that unemployment and inflation go hand-in-hand. I think if you will remember back historically when Truman went out of office, the unemployment rate was under 3 percent and the inflation rate was below 1 percent. The budget was balanced. When the Kennedy and Johnson administration was over and Richard Nixon came into office, he had a balanced budget; the unemployment rate was under 4 percent I think the average inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent. Under this administration we have had extremely high unemployment--it is now 7.9 percent--at least twice that among minority groups--sometimes as much as five times that in young minority groups. At the same time, we have had unprecedented inflation. We haven't had this high inflation rate since the War Between the States. We have not had this high of a deficit in the history of our country. Those things go together. I would address this as a combination because they go hand-in-hand. One is to restore the integrity of some of the federal programs--like housing; we have about 20 percent unemployment rate in the construction industry. Nixon impounded the housing funds that had been set up under the Democratic Administration. Ford has never restored the strength of the housing program. I remember when FHA was a notable and successful federal entity. Last year, it lost $600 million. HUD, which is Housing and Urban Development Department, has had 500 indictments and 200 convictions and it has now become the world's greatest slum landlord. Here effective housing programs, unemployment in housing and construction industry go hand in hand. Another very important point is this. We need to orient the services of federal programs that are on the books as the Congress originally intended for the people who need them the most. When you have programs involving pollution control, health care, education, recreation, transportation, law enforcement, the Congress intended for those monies to go to people who needed them the most. But because of the Republican administration and because of the good campaign or political organization of more influential people--because they have more influence and are more articulate--those monies that ought to be going to the ghetto areas of downtown cities or the devastated families in isolated rural communities--have been going into the more affluent parts of our country and also into the more affluent suburban areas who needed the help least.

There are a lot of reasons--I won't make a whole speech on that--but we have lost respect for the government aspect of enforcing the law. The highest law enforcement in this country is the Attorney General. Under this Nixon-Ford administration, we've had two Attorneys General who were indicted and convicted of serious crimes, and, we've seen, brought on our government a continual series of disgraces. The average person feels that they're not treated fairly under our present system of justice. If an average working family had a young man caught with some marijuana or involved in a hit-and-run accident, that young man would likely go to prison. If a powerful or rich person had the same thing happen to one of his children, the chances are that child would never see the inside of a prison. The rich, the powerful, the constant criminal quite often can escape. When I became governor of Georgia, there was a drug pusher in Atlanta who had been indicted fifty-two times.

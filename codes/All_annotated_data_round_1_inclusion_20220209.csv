"We are opposing Communism abroad, where its relentless pressure seeks further to narrow the area of freedom. We are opposing it at home where its agents and converts seek to undermine our society and corrupt our government. As I have repeatedly said, the federal government must use all its resources to expose and identify Communistic activity, to keep Communists out of places of responsibility in our society, and to protect our institutions from Communist espionage, sabotage and subversion.

"Well, the best answer I know to Republican fears is Democratic facts. These facts go back, of course, twenty years. Youngstown was not, in 1932, a pleasant place to work or to live--and Youngstown was typical of most of the cities of America. The steel mills here in the Mahoning Valley were working at 31 percent of capacity. One Youngstown working man out of every three was unemployed. There was no unemployment compensation. The other two men worked at poverty wages. There was no minimum wage law. Those men worked in silence beside the furnaces. There was no collective bargaining act. The foreman's word was law. The working man had no seniority rights in his job and there was almost no collective bargaining contracts; almost no unions. At the end of life's work when you could no longer work, there was nothing. There was no social security. You only knew that one day--and you never knew when--there would be a pink dismissal slip in your envelope, and that would be all. If it was bad at the mill, it was infinitely worse in the street and in the home. Youngstown was one of the first cities to start soup kitchens. So desperate indeed did the city of Youngstown become that the City Council...",0,1013_6,1013_6
"Mr. Conte, ladies and gentlemen, and boys and girls: I see by that sign down there that Dunkirk is for Stevenson. But I still don't feel that I am wasting my time by coming out here, and I am very grateful to all of you for being here, and to all of these children. I hope you are not cutting school.",0,1016_0,1016_0
"This is a very happy experience for me and I am deeply touched and grateful to all of you for coming here and making my arrival in Albany so agreeable. I want to say to you that one of the happiest experiences that I have had in my brief life as a politician has been today in New York state. Not the least of it has been the fact that I have been privileged to travel with one of the most beloved and respected citizens of our generation, your Senator Herbert Lehman of New York.",0,1018_2,1018_2
"There always has to be a whistle in a whistle-stop, as far as I can see. May I thank the band for coming out here this morning. You have done me a great courtesy, and I am very grateful to you.",0,1021_9,1021_9
"My heart is very much in these programs because whenever you travel through this great land of ours, you can't help but see how much these programs have meant to so many people. Above all, our Democratic platform calls for action on the overshadowing problems of war and peace--the most important unfinished business of our generation--and I mean steady resistance to Communism and patient and persistent efforts to build a peace which has been man's dearest goal from time immemorial. Now, in these few words--if these were all that you knew about me and about our Democratic platform, well, I will have to confess that you wouldn't know very much for it is easy to get up here on a campaign train and say some nice sounding words, but out of our party you get a lot more than some high sounding words--you get first of all the record of twenty years of solid accomplishment, of accomplishment in the interests of all our people, and I hope you will compare this record with the Republican record before you vote--for, by the way, they have a record too during these past twenty years, and it is easy to sum up that record. Whenever there has been a forward looking, a constructive program to oppose, they have opposed it, and that is about all their record amounts to.",0,1023_2,2016-11-02-amphitheater-miami-florida_71
"And I wish that these men of little faith could see America, as I have seen it; could talk to the countless thousands that I have had the privilege of meeting with, like you here this afternoon, all across our broad rich land during these past two months. America is a great, a strong, a wise, and most of all a good country. And I believe with all my heart that by these qualities, we can and we will safely in God's good time win our way to a peaceful world.",0,1023_6,1023_6
"Well, the world passed them by. Since then, we have been through a Great Depression, a great recovery and a devastating war. And somewhere in this process America has fundamentally changed--a new view, a new compassion, a new faith has emerged. In a way it is a moral revival, and it has altered the tone and the meaning of our life. And how different a prospect faces a young man or a young woman of today from what faced the youth of my generation. The only or, most of all, the go-getter was the hero. Few cared about politics or public service -almost none who went through school or college with me took any positive interest in that, or have subsequently. Few had the sense of civil or social responsibility that we find today, when they were young.",0,1032_10,1032_10
"But if we deal with this problem foolishly, we risk atomic war, on the one hand, or ignominious surrender, on the other--in either case, the destruction of freedom and civilization. I ask you: to whom should our people entrust the fight against Communism--to those Old Guard Republicans who, on one issue after another, vote the way our enemies like to see them vote? Or to those who have rallied the free world against Communist aggression?",0,1033_17,1033_17
"Of course they don't mean to aid and abet our enemies; but the results are the same. Are these the men we want to lead our nation in the struggle against Communism today? All the while they proclaim ferocious anti-Communism. Indeed, the best way they can apparently find to obscure their retreat from the fight against Communism abroad, the fight to keep it distant from our shores, is by shouting and screaming every hour on the hour about how much they hate Communism at home.",0,1033_23,1033_23
"As I have said repeatedly in this campaign, if I find any Communists or fellow travelers or Soviet agents or dupes in our federal government, I will root them out promptly and ruthlessly. In fighting Communists at home, I shall rely on such experienced guardians of our security as J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and General Bedell Smith of the Central Intelligence Agency. These men fight Communism as it must be fought--with care, thoroughness, precision--and silence.",0,1033_28,1033_28
"Mayor Capeless and my friends: I hope the time will never come when I believe all of the nice things that introducers say about me. In all events, I am very grateful to all of you for being here this afternoon. I have just had a most interesting experience. I was presented on the rear platform of the train with an enormous placard--here it is--they are all of the Ike buttons, gathered by the Volunteers for Stevenson from people who have switched.",0,1035_0,3344_12
"Now there is no point in going over in detail the whole program of people's legislation which has been enacted in the past twenty years by President Roosevelt, by President Truman, and by the Democratic party. But that program of service to the people--of the meeting of the people's needs--is still far from complete. We face the immediate problem of counteracting the inflationary forces which have driven our cost of living up too high. So, we of the Democratic party support a strong and firm policy of direct and indirect cost of living controls, while at the same time the Republicans in Congress vote to punch holes in the price controls, in the tax laws, and to end rent controls completely.",0,1036_9,2228_4
"Now, you know, I wouldn't say, my friends, that this proves conclusively that the Old Guard Republicans are really Communists, but I suppose if I were an Old Guard Republican I would, because that is exactly the way they argue. The great transformation which has overtaken our country in these twenty years has come about, in great part, because we have had a new spirit and a new purpose in our government--you could almost feel the change from confusion to confidence, from fear to faith, when the election of 1932 produced a great new leader, Franklin Roosevelt. And that was only the beginning of the process by which America began to lift itself out of the depths, both economically and spiritually, and onto a new plane of social responsibility and of decency. Government assumed responsibilities to avert economic catastrophe and to assure reasonable levels of security for the people. By doing this, great new energies within the people were unlocked. Of course, this new activity on the part of government aroused resentment. The Old Guard began raising their tired old refrain of socialism, and regimentation; you have heard these cries against every new idea in American history since the post office and the public schools.",0,1037_2,2039_27
"First, we must recognize that not alone for Americans, but for men everywhere, body and spirit are co-principals of the same being. Each needs a special sort of ministry. Let us remember that, while Christ preached the doctrine of eternal salvation, he also did the work that needed to be done in the kingdom of man. He healed the sick, fed the poor, sustained the weak, and sheltered all those who were in want. So must we, I think, as Americans continue prudently to extend to the needy of this earth that material help which we almost alone can give. And we ought to do this not grudgingly, but with a clear recognition that it is far better to give than to receive. In a word, the first answer to Communism is not a lesser, but a fuller application of Judaic- Christian ethics to the neighborhood of nations around us.",0,1038_9,1038_9
"Mr. Chairman, I just happened to run across one thing that a group was doing in some town in Illinois which is illustrative of what I mean by the variety of possibilities. They were merely beautifying the state highway at the access point of the city, where it began to come into the city. And where it had been shabby and ugly and messy they were cleaning it up around there and developing a picnic area--that sort of thing--and an infinite variety of things. Also, of course, from the point of view of the public official, it is a wonderful access point to communities.",0,1039_3,1039_3
"I am frank to say we have had very little cooperation from some of the veteran's posts. They are awful keen about this law enforcement, but they continue to use all these devices in their own posts. So it is a little incongruous. They say, """"""""By gosh, we are going to clean up crime in this community and get those slot machines out of that corner saloon. But of course, as far as our Legion Post, or VFW, or whatever it is, that belongs to us and it is certainly a different situation. And after all, the device is set to give the fellow at least a sixty to a hundred chance of winning as against one chance in a hundred in the commercial device; and, after all, we own the machine, and it is not owned by a syndicate of operators and placed on a rental basis."""""""" And so on and so on.",0,1039_6,1039_6
"You know, they used to say in Washington in the early days of the war that you were likely to contract one of three diseases--either ulcers, galloping frustration, or a sense of humor. I have never felt better; I feel frustrated only by the difficulty I have had in engaging in any genuine debate with the Republicans; and, as far as my sense of humor is concerned, I hope it is intact. And I hope the time will never come when the Republican party gets into office and forbids any humor in political campaigns.",0,1040_8,1040_8
"There has been loose talk of a war of liberation to free the enslaved peoples of Eastern Europe. Such a war is unthinkable and would destroy the very people and the civilization that we seek to save. Yet the day of liberation will come, and there is much we can do in the meantime to help the unhappy people of Eastern Europe. Through the United Nations much is being done to rally the conscience of mankind. We can offer help and encouragement to those thousands of families and those individuals who are escaping, month by month, through the chinks in the Iron Curtain.",0,1043_11,1043_11
"We can make our society ever more productive and more abundant and our people ever more free, but only if we have the purpose, the vision and the determination to do so. We can win peace in the world without a third world war, but only by dedicating our minds and our hearts, our sweat and our blood to that great task for as long as may be necessary. I tell you that the way to our goal is not easy, but the goal is worth the price, for the goal is nothing less than a nation fair and productive beyond our dreams and a world of law and order where men of good will can live together in equal dignity and under God. This is the future that we seek and this is the future for which I know we are willing to work and to sacrifice and to labor with all of our minds and with all of our hearts, and this is the cause to which we call you. We don't call it a crusade--we just call it, """"""""Forward with America.""""""""",0,1045_13,1045_13
"There is some very important business before our nation, as you all know, and it encourages me to think that these many groups we see all the time have a strong feeling we had better leave the management of our affairs in the hands of the Democratic party. And one reason for this is that it has become harder and harder instead of easier and easier to tell precisely what the Republican party stands for in this campaign. I confess it is early in the morning to be harsh about anybody and to be very critical of anybody. I don't want to be critical or harsh. I have in mind that we are now only a week from our election and we still don't know precisely what the Republicans propose to do about much of anything. We know where they stand on the matter of a new labor relations law, for example. That is precisely where they stood for the past five years. That is an old Republican position.",0,1047_1,1047_1
"I have been surprised to find that in some of the northern sections of the country there is a certain suspicion of Southerners. There is a provincial assumption--and fortunately not very widespread--that any man in public life in the South is bound to be a reactionary, or worse. If anyone can dispel this illusion, once and for all, John Sparkman is the man to do it.",0,1051_14,1036_9
"I think, regardless of political considerations, that it is essential that if we are going to win in the long term this conflict with Communists--this conflict with a society that seeks to spread itself over the entire globe--that we must recognize that until we find the means--and until we find cooperation in the means of restoring a sense of well-being to peoples who know little of freedom in the terms that we understand it, that we will have a very threatening and a hostile enemy. That is why one can believe that the importance of bolstering our defenses by the foreign aid programs--Point Four, and things of that kind--are essential if we are going to hope to frustrate the designs of this godless tyranny throughout the world. I thank you so much for affording me this opportunity of participating even briefly in the ceremonies. I count you very fortunate indeed to have this splendid housing development in your neighborhood; and I can add that I am very jealous of it. I should like to be participating in a similar project in Chicago where we too have desperate need of the advantages of public housing.",0,1054_5,1054_5
"I don't believe that these changes in the nature of business have been adequately recognized by everyone in government. I think we must sweep out of the corridors of government, at all levels, national and state, those lingering suspicions which are a holdover from an earlier and very different time.  This is a problem which concerns me very deeply, for I am convinced that both government and business must learn to live together in harmony, before an era of bad temper turns into something infinitely worse. We must avoid at all costs the bitter struggle of class against class, which results inevitably in a drift either to the extreme left or to the extreme right. And you and I know that either kind of drift would end up at the same dreadful destination: a police state with all of the horrors that we have seen in Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia.

"We must do nothing that might array class against class, or citizen against citizen, in quarrels which tear apart our blessed American family. I shall do all I can to sustain a feeling of mutual confidence and understanding among all segments of our society. I see the American people rejoicing in their strength and sure of their destiny--and I see them from coast to coast--and for such a brotherhood among our people, I think everything is possible.

"I am most grateful to all of you for coming out here at this inconvenient hour and I appreciate your courtesy, and I am sure that your presence here is a good omen both for the Democratic party and for our country. When so many people get up so early in the morning to hear about the great issues on which we will make a decision next Tuesday, we can all feel confident that the future of America rests in responsible hands. It is a sign that every one of you is taking seriously your duty as a citizen; for, in our country it is the people who make all of the final decisions.",0,1068_1,1068_1

"Greece and Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean were saved by prompt action by President Truman and the Congress and they were saved in spite of the blind obstruction of the Old Guard Republicans. Who gave us the Marshall Plan which prevented the Kremlin's bloodless conquest of Western Europe? Who faced up to the Russians in Berlin when they tried to strangle and seize that city? Who insisted on the heroic airlift and who was it that hammered out the North Atlantic Alliance, which banded together the free people of Europe in a united defense against Communist aggression?",0,1073_22,1073_22
"Then--then the people will vote on Tuesday. I understand that on Wednesday the newspapers plan to publish a Five-Star Final. Many thousands of our votes will come from rank-and-file Republicans who will vote with us. No doubt some Democrats will vote for the Republican candidates. We have already, for example, traded a couple of southern governors for the senator from Oregon and the vice chairman of the National Young Republicans. And I regard this as a profitable exchange for us. I would be happy to throw in a second baseman--but not Jackie Robinson.",0,1074_2,1074_2
"     We are not only, as I say, a moral country.  This is a brave and a generous country, I think we are bearing our responsibilities well as the strong leader of the free nations against the threat of Soviet communism.  We are doing the hard job that must be done if we are to have a secure place for ourselves and for those children.  We are following out the high ideals of Woodrow Wilson, who wanted to take us our full part--give us our full part--accept our full responsibility for securing the peace back in 1920 after the first World War.  The American people didn't listen to Wilson in those days.  We turned instead to people who led us away from the hard road of international cooperation to the easy  path of isolation.  If we had listened to him we might well have avoided the terrible trial of the second World War, in which 300,000 of our young men died.",0,1076_4,1076_4
"     We Democrats are for private and we are for profitable business.  We know America could not survive with any other kind.  We are for the dynamic system of enterprise which has grown out of the great partnership of public and private initiative in this country.

"     And their voting record on farm policy is open for everyone to examine.  It is a record of opposition and harassment for 20 years, not only on price supports, but on all of the other Democratic programs on the storage program, rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, rural electric coops and so on.  The Republican Old Guard has never understood the philosophy behind these programs; it has never understood the programs themselves; it has never understood how they work.  The warning is plain; the Old Guard is hoping that the General can make his easy promises to farmers so convincing that they will forget about their own voting record.",0,1082_7,1082_7
"Democratic administrations have fought to bring these things to you, not because that would win votes, but because they were right and just and fair.  And we are going to continue to shout and do what we think is right to extend the gains that we have made here at home, and to fight for peace abroad. In the conduct of our foreign affairs we will suffer no tyranny over us, just as we will suffer no tyranny of one American over another.  We want to impose no tyranny on any other people.  We will remain free ourselves--more so.  We will find, as we have found before, the balance between the power we generate and the brakes that will check the power of those hostile to us.  In this way we can move in the wide open world as our fathers did when our nation was founded, and we can move unafraid.  I am reluctant to stop, although I have talked entirely too much, both here and all throughout this campaign.  All the same I have left much unsaid that is in my heart.

We must approach those group problems with a spirit of cooperation, a readiness to accept the responsibilities of each of us which are group in character.  If we do not do that then there comes that creeping tide of central law that finally results in the all-powerful state, and we do it because we are regimented.

Once we have gotten that thought in our minds so that we never forget it, ladies and gentlemen, we can clean out corruption.  Why, think of it, think of the votes we can roll up on November 4th.  We can bring down taxes; we can stop the terrific taxes that are piling up your prices.  An economist came into me the other day, one of these fellows, you know, that dig out the facts.

In my own mind I have complete confidence that this job of amending the law can be worked out so that no fair-minded member of your group will consider the results unreasonable.

Like the rest of the things we will cast out, this too is a product of fear and lack of faith in the people.  This idea that government is the people's master is widespread in our world.

I think that the administration in Washington has gone too far in damaging, indeed leading toward destruction of the kind of America we have known, loved and believe in.  That administration has not led us intelligently toward peace.  It is spending more than it earns.  Indeed, it earns nothing.  It is spending more than it takes from us in the highest taxes we have ever had, and leaves a deficit in the budget that further cheapens our money.",0,1155_2,1155_2

We must have a solvent America, an America that lives within its means, yet so far have they gone with these spendthrift policies that the government itself says that last year every city family had to spend $400 more than that family could earn to pay for its shelter, its food, its clothing and other necessities in the family.

At times the pitiless pressure of Communism has been checked by brave emergency attempts that rallied men of all parties to make up the deficiencies in our national leadership.  These attempts have produced the economic help of the Marshall Plan and the program of military aid to Greece and Turkey.  Both were enactments of the Republican 80th Congress, the Congress so long vilified by the administration.  These measures have helped to steady both the economic and the nervous systems of our allies.  They could hardly have been expected to do more in the making of our foreign policy.

They even call the great war in Korea a police action. Ladies and gentlemen, this all adds up to one simple thing--we have got to have a change and I am not expressing here just my individual opinion.  I am bringing to you what I believe I have seen in the faces and I know I have seen in the telegrams and the notes and the letters and the telephone calls of thousands of Americans.  We can no longer put up with that kind of leadership, a leadership that does not bring us closer to peace in the world and they well know that we can have no peace in the world as long as we have a government that cannot excite your pride.

And we came to the agreement in simple terms that we were fighting to keep America the kind of land that we believe it to be--a land of freedom and opportunity, not a land dominated by a Hitler or by any group of bureaucrats.  The reason I am in this political campaign, my friends, is in a continuation of that promise.

What the Republicans have said is this:  our purpose is to keep the dollar from going down further so that there will be no further erosion of your savings account, of your bank account, of your insurance policy and of your bonds.  But instead of seeing those things go down the drain of inflation you will keep them, and moreover they have said that where inflation has already overtaken some of these things, these amounts, and they have gone down below decency, that must be corrected, which means corrected upward.

Now, if we are going to have a fresh start on this thing, we have got to have a complete change in the political complexion in Washington.  I picked up this morning a little clipping.  I am going to read to you just two sentences:  In South Bend, Indiana, yesterday, someone from the crowd addressed by the Democratic candidate, the administration's hand-picked candidate, shouted this question, """"""""Would you fire Acheson?""""""""

He has the record, this sorry record of the last seven years to defend, and here is one he can't defend; but he can't on the other hand, say in advance, I repudiate that record and the people who have made it.  But I say, this crusade in which I am engaged does repudiate that record of error, and we are ready to replace from top to bottom.  No one has anything but admiration for the great body of public servants of America who are contained in the civil service and in the uniformed services.

There is no easier way to get out of a situation.  What I promise you is work, never ending work, to make certain that justice is done.  So I cannot come before you with the competition of promises, but I do come before you with a pledge, and this is the pledge.

It was a very, very wonderful promise.  I sincerely appreciated it, but what has happened?  If you are going to educate, you have to start with the record, with the facts.  Who among you here would like the job of defending the record of the government of the past seven years?  Well, I don't have to ask that one again.  Of course, they can't defend that record, a record in which, with all of the assets and resources of this great nation with which we came out of World War II, they have frittered them away--as they have struggled and fumbled and stumbled and fallen in the foreign field.

Now, the first thing that is necessary to lead our country toward peace is a strong America; and the first thing that means a strong America is an employed America--a prosperous America--that stands as an example of what free government can do for its citizens in this world.

"The fact is that the Republicans, taking over the country at a high point of economic activity, have done nothing for such vital groups in the population as small businessmen and farmers--and have done less than nothing to prepare for the difficult problems of the future.

First of all, we must rededicate ourselves to our faith in democracy and make that faith a living principle. In the Middle East, Israel is a beacon of democratic faith and of twentieth century progress. Our policy, therefore, should be founded on the firm cornerstone of the friendship of the American people for its democratic friend--Israel. For three years we have tried the ignoble, expedient policy of isolating Israel and trying to buy the friendship of dictators. Colonel Nasser has given us his answer. Appeasement has once again proved neither wise nor honorable nor expedient.",0,1376_4,1376_4

He didn't say so because he knew that any such statement would have cost him.",0,1377_5,3344_16

Just because this administration has not been able to make any progress toward safe disarmament or even toward controlling H-bomb development, does not mean that such agreements are forever impossible.

There has been special medical research in the diseases of the aged. There have been special programs started in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare so that the people that are chronically ill, although not acutely ill, could have proper hospital care or proper care within a hospital center.

This is our task, not only for those who are in the Congress and in the state gubernatorial chairs and in the legislatures.

The day of liberation may be postponed where armed forces for a time make protest suicidal.

In that time, as you recall, the great issue was whether this country could stay united, whether it would, in the words of Lincoln, exist half slave and half free.  The issue in the election of 1960 involves not only the well-being of the people of this valley, involves not only the development of your natural resources, but as citizens of the United States and leaders of the free world, we must be concerned about such far-off places as the Congo, India, and Indonesia, the security of those countries, as well as the well-being of their people.

For here and around the world, the fear of war hangs over us every morning and every night. It lies, expressed or silent, in the minds of every American. We cannot banish it by repeating that we are economically first or that we are militarily first, for saying so doesn't make it so.

I think we need an administration which so regards it. We spend $42 billion on defense every year. Those ships sail the oceans. They protect us but they do not serve our people and the world. I do not regard the distribution of food around the world as a great burden upon us. I regard it as an opportunity, to use our assets in a way which will attract people to the cause of freedom. I am glad that this is our problem, and not starvation. I am glad we can produce more than we can consume, if we share it usefully, for we are our brother's keeper; and if we have great assets in this country, I believe we should hold out the hand of friendship. When hundreds of millions of people stagger through their lives searching for food and we have it, and we are trying to determine which way the world will go, I would rather see our food used in an imaginative way than to argue in kitchens or anyplace else.

I think the farmers of North Dakota and the farmers of South Dakota and of Minnesota and Montana have a very clear choice. The question is which party and which candidate can meet their problems in this state, and meet their in this country. They have heard from the Democratic party and they have heard from the Republican party. I remember when President Truman used to say that the farmers had themselves to blame for their difficulties because they voted Republican in 1952. But I don't hold that view wholly, because in 1952, the farmers were informed that the Republican party stood for 100 percent parity not once but at least three times.",0,1526_2,1526_2
"On the great domestic issues of resource development, minimum wage, housing, aid to education, Social Security, aid for the aged--all the rest, it has been a history of the Democrats proposing, the Republicans opposing, and then at least in the last eight years fighting for an unsatisfactory compromise. The Senate is Democratic, and we could not mathematically lose control of the Senate. The House of Representatives is Democratic by a wide margin, and I doubt that the Democrats in the House of Representatives will lose control. Therefore, the prospect of four or eight years of a divided government, a government manned by a highly partisan figure, manned by a highly partisan party in the executive branch, and we have seen evidence of it in the last few days--how can we hope, at a time when we need action, how can we hope to possibly move ahead when on the one hand we say yes with the Democrats, and on the other hand we say no with the Republicans? The experience of the month of August in the Congress when both parties were vocally committed to great programs, housing, education, minimum wage, care for the aged--every program fell between the two opposing philosophies of the two parties.",0,1530_3,1530_3

He boasts of tremendous power development during the past eight years, and he asserted that the Russians can overtake us only if we did nothing for fifteen years, while they built eight Grand Coulee Dams a year.  That is his charge and what are the facts?  The facts were reported last year by a committee of the U.S. Senate, over which Mr. Nixon occasionally presides.  That committee's findings, and I quote, were """"""""Although the United States is still far ahead, the Russians could overtake us in 1975, in fifteen years, unless we speed up or they slow down.

But instead of holding out a helping hand of friendship to the desperate people of Cuba, nearly all our aid was in the form of weapons assistance--assistance which merely strengthened the Batista dictatorship--assistance which completely failed to advance the economic welfare of the Cuban people--assistance which enabled Castro and the Communists to encourage the growing belief that America was indifferent to Cuban aspirations for a decent life.",0,1588_10,1588_10

Now, as the market price drops so drops the support price.  Where you had $1.50 for corn eight years ago, you may be getting 90 cents for corn today, or 93 cents.  That is the market price.

This country is not moving ahead like it is going to have to move ahead if we are going to meet our responsibilities to ourselves, to those who come after us, to those who look to us around the world for leadership.  And our position in the world is not unparalleled; our prestige has been higher.  Our strength relative to that of the Communists has been greater.  If Mr. Nixon hopes to be president of the United States and present the United States to the world in the same image that he now presents it in this campaign, I could not disagree with him more.  I hope you share the view with me that we want the truth with the bark off.  The people of the United States want to face the facts.

If we are educating our children by giving them the best education we can--and it is a sober fact that ten years ago we were turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union, and now one-half as many--if we are going to educate our children, providing full use of the capacity of our plants and men and potential of our industries in the United States, providing medical care for the aged tied to social security--some kind of security to our older citizens--if we are providing opportunity for all citizens to advance their potential, then we are building a strong and vital society here at home, and then we speak with purpose around the world.",0,1691_2,1691_2

That peace must be based on world law and world order, on the mutual respect of all nations for the rights and powers of others and on a world economy in which no nation lacks the ability to provide a decent standard of living for all of its people.  But we cannot have such a world, and we cannot have such a peace, unless the United States has the vitality and the inspiration and the strength.",0,1697_13,1952_19

The point of the matter is that the Republican party and Mr. Nixon in his fourteen years of association with it have not stood for progress, have not stood for breaking new ground, have not stood for breaking new frontiers, and I believe in the 1960s, if the United States is going to fulfill its potential, if we are going to fulfill the destiny which is in store for us in the sixties, if we are going to be the leader of freedom, we are going to have to move here at home.  I come to Philadelphia and ask your help in this campaign.  This election is the means to an end, and the end is a great, stronger, and growing America.

We need in a free society, where the responsibility lies with the people, with their own good judgment and sense of responsibility and restraint, we want the best-educated people in the world.

I believe the United States is going to have to move in the 1960s, and I believe a responsible, forward-looking president and vice president, working with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, can move this country forward, can provide prosperity for our people, education for our children, security for our older citizens, a better deal for our farmers, the development of our natural resources.

Having seen him four times close up in this campaign and made up, I would not accuse Mr. Nixon of being barefaced, but I think the American people next Tuesday can determine who is telling the truth.  Mr. Nixon may tell us to forget the Republican party, he may tell us that he speaks for all the people, but I don't think the people of this state of New Mexico and the people of the United States are going to forget the record of the Republican party which he so well represents.

And, fourth, we will begin a large-scale effort to assist those communities in the United States, communities that are represented by Pat Jennings, by the people of West Virginia, which have been hard hit, chronically, which have seen men and machines go idle.  Here in this rich country of ours we are producing steel at about 55 percent of capacity.  We built this year 30 percent less homes than a year ago.  By November, the middle of November of this year, we will have more cars unsold than we have ever had in our history.  That is the record Mr. Nixon runs on.

"This campaign is coming to an end Tuesday night.  Then you have to decide.  You have to make your judgment.  I made my judgment long ago that the basic issue of this campaign was the question of whether the people of the United States believed it was time they started moving again, that they started going forward again, and that the greatest contribution that they could make to the cause of freedom was to build a strong and vital society here in the United States.  Mr. Nixon has chosen a different road.  He has gone to the American people in the 1960s, in the time of change and revolution, saying, """"We've never had it so good,"""" saying our prestige in the world has never been higher.  I recall in 1935, when Winston Churchill was warning of the dangers of the Nazi rise, Stanley Baldwin, the leader of the Conservative party, told the people of England that everything was being done in its own good time.

That is the issue in this campaign.

Let me make it clear this campaign is now coming to an end, and tomorrow the respective responsibilities of Mr. Nixon and myself cease, and yours begin. What are the issues in this campaign that any voter should consider before they vote?  In my judgment they are two: first, there is the point of view expressed by the Vice President that this country has never been stronger, that our security is assured, that we are experiencing and enjoying unprecedented prosperity from one end of the country to the other, and that the way to win the peace is by journeys through Eastern Europe in order to inform them of the value of freedom.  I want to make it clear that Mr. Nixon may decide, if he is elected, to go to Eastern Europe, but I am going to Washington, D.C., because that is the place.

In addition, I come here and ask your support in this campaign for the presidency.

And to accomplish these things, we will develop to the fullest the untapped natural resources our water, our minerals, our power with which we are so fortunate to be blessed in this rich land of ours. And we shall provide for our scientists, the support they need for the research that will open exciting new highways into the future--new highways in which we shall have progress which we cannot even dream of today.

Why do I set that particular standard?

"And now, if I may be permitted to say just a word about an issue related to our economic progress with which the people of North Dakota are greatly concerned, and issue that I'm going to comment upon in a major speech at Guthrie Center, Idaho, on Friday: the contributions that the nation's farmers have been making and can make in the future toward the strength of America economically in the struggle in which we're engaged. First of all, let's recognize a fundamental fact. You hear a lot of talk about the farm problem these days, and from a political standpoint it's a difficult one. But let's never forget that there is no greater asset that we have in our struggle with the forces of slavery than the tremendous incredible productivity of America's farmers. Mr. Khrushchev knows this. He told me when he got back to Washington that he was pretty impressed with what he saw on the farms in Iowa that he visited, and he has reason to know it and I'll tell you why: because here in the United States approximately 6.5 million farmers and farmworkers produce as much as 50 million farmers and farmworkers produce in the Soviet Union. That, you see, gives us a tremendous advantage which we must retain. But since we owe this to our farmers, we must see that our farmers get what they do not receive today, and that is a fair share of America's increasing prosperity, and this can be done. The problem is difficult. As I've indicated, I'm going to touch upon it in detail in Iowa on Friday and a speech in South Dakota at the national plowing contest the next night.",0,1752_19,1752_19

"Some of you know that for several months I have been making a careful study of the situation confronting our farm people, and in the process have met with the most knowledgeable and objective-minded people I could find.  What I want to do today is to talk over with you some of my views based on this serious study. At the outset I would like this point clearly understood: the problems of farm people ought not be approached, as far too often has been the case in the past, as something to exploit for political advantage.  Rather, the approach has got to be objective, and has got to be constructive.  In a determined effort to find a solution, the good of the farmer, not the good of politicians, has to be our steady purpose if we are ever to get anywhere.",0,1755_1,1755_1
"I think it's one of the primary responsibilities of a presidential candidate and, certainly, an overriding responsibility of a president himself to emphasize these great ideals that join us together, to unite Americans rather than to divide them sectionally into occupations and the like, and that's why I refuse to go before one group and make them promises that will set them against another.  I think we must emphasize the things that unite America.  I pointed out in speaking to a great labor organization yesterday the fact that Mr. Kennedy had been in Detroit and made the statement that he was for everything union leaders were for, in effect, and that he opposed everything that they were against.  And I said to this group, """"Look, I'm for many of the things your leaders are for, but I'm not for all the things and I will not make a commitment that I'm for all the things that the leaders of unions or management or farm organizations or any other part or group of America are for, because a president must be president of all America and not just part of America.""""",0,1757_10,1757_10

I could tell you that the way to get it is just to leave it to Washington, that Washington is going to provide the jobs and the schools and the progress we need, but that isn't the way it work in this country of ours.  The way to progress in America is not through putting the responsibility on the federal government, but for the federal government to adopt policies that will stimulate the incentive and the creative ability of 180 million free Americans, just such as you here.",0,1758_12,1758_12
"Out at the airport today greeting us were a number of very interesting groups but one that particularly impressed me were 300 Boy Scouts in uniform, standing at attention--not in the goose-step rigid attention that you see in a totalitarian country like the Soviet Union in a pioneer camp for youth--but standing in the way Boy Scout groups usually stand, with the freedom of movement and expression that we expect from an organization of that type.  The thing that ran through my mind I'm sure was what would run through your mind--that the most important question and the most important responsibility for the next president of the United States is to see that those boys and thousands like them are always in uniforms of peace and never have to be in uniforms of war. And so I say to you today that the most important responsibility of the next president is to keep the peace without surrender and that is the question you should ask--which of the candidates--which of the two for president and vice president will best provide that leadership.

So, first, because he is a man who understands power and respects it, because he is a man who will use power if he can get away with it, to accomplish his ends, we must make sure that he never believes he is strong enough and that we are weak enough that he could start something without risking national suicide on his own part. And, so, the first necessity of leadership in these critical years ahead is that the United States must continue to be what she is today--the strongest nation in the world.  And, my friends, we must continue to maintain that advantage that we presently have, and the next president must be prepared to ask the American people for whatever was necessary to maintain it because through that strength in our hands, we serve the cause of peace.

We stand for strengthening the rights of the states and they stand for weakening them, and I submit to you that ours is the position that you support and not theirs on this issue as well.",0,1785_11,1785_11
"And so in all these areas we welcome the test--the test of the record, the test of our program. There is one other you should submit us to.  I know the people have spoken to me and they have said, """"""""Now Mr. Nixon, you say that you stand for more progress than your opponent does.  You stand for more progress in schools and health and education and welfare.""""""""  They say, """"""""How can you say this when he says he is going to spend more money for each of these programs than you do?""""""""",0,1785_19,1785_19
"And so, how are we going to do it?  You must look at our record.  We have been a part of that record, and we're proud of it.  But again, we don't stand on it.  How do I say that we can do this job?  Well, first, when you look at my colleague and I, we know Mr. Khrushchev.  We have sat down across the conference table with him.  We know that he is a man who is ruthless and tough.  We know that you must never make him a concession unless you get a concession in return.  That's why President Eisenhower was right in not doing what Mr. Khrushchev asked him to do again in the paper this morning, in not apologizing and not expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev as Senator Kennedy suggested he might.  That is why the next president of the United States must recognize that Mr. Khrushchev does not react like Mr. Nehru, he isn't like Mr. Adenauer, or Mr. Macmillan.  He is a man determined to conquer the world and so, first, we will keep America strong--the strongest in the world.  Second, we will see that the economy of this country moves forward so that Mr. Khrushchev never will be able to get through on his boast that """"""""he is going to catch us.""""""""  Third, we will see that we are firm, but we will never be belligerent, because we realize that while we hold the line for principle, we must always negotiate for peace, but never, again, making concessions, as I say, which don't get concessions in return.",0,1786_14,1786_14
"Now, talking to that point for a moment, naturally, you have to assume I'm a little prejudiced on that point, but I want to point out that my colleague, Cabot Lodge, and I, begin with a record, and you must hold us accountable for that record.  For seven and a half years we have been part of the Eisenhower administration.  We have sat in the Cabinet, in the Security Council.  We have participated in the discussions leading to the great decisions on Lebanon, Quemoy, and Matsu, and others with which you are familiar.",0,1787_9,1787_9
"Whatever test you want to make, my friends, when you compare the Eisenhower seven years with the seven years, it's Eisenhower every time--and that's what we stand for. Now, we stand not on this.  We do not say this is where we are going to stay.  We say that a record is not something to stand on, but something to build on, and we will build a better future.",0,1788_15,2004-10-19-petersburg-florida-0_35
"I say the President does not set up, as Mr. Khrushchev does, a spectacular phony disarmament plan.  He sets forth before the United Nations a program that will work, one that will make certain that when one party disarms, the other does likewise, and unless we have that kind of agreement, America can never reduce its strength--and I know all of you agree with that. And, so, I say to you tonight: I stand here speaking of this record.  I stand here talking of experience but most of all, I stand here to tell you that my colleague and I, knowing the men with whom we deal, know that we can never rest for a moment on our record, that we must move forward militarily.  We must move forward economically.  We must always keep the initiative in the diplomatic arena, and we will.",0,1788_43,1788_43

The British have prepared it--as the Congo was not prepared, unfortunately--for independence.  We hope and we trust that it will be able to develop its independence.  And I hope and I trust that the people of New York with all of the greatness of heart which they've always shown will give him a magnificent welcome here.  I hope that they do it because--I want to tell you what happens to Africa, my friends, affects us in America.  It affects us in Europe, the Middle East, in Asia.",0,1789_23,1789_23

We have a great humanitarian concern, and one of the reasons that we have developed this concern is because of the contribution made by people that make up the mainstream of American life.  Who are they?  They came from all the countries of the world.  Warm-hearted Italians, people from Europe, from Asia, from Africa, these are Americans.  And because America is the whole world, America will always have a feeling and a concern for misery and hunger and want in the whole world.",1,1789_33,1789_33
"And, I say that as far as the American people are concerned, while this is a kind of a program that is not one the demagogues will be pleased with, it is one that will bring to the people the increase in their progress, and the increase in jobs and job opportunities that every American wants.  And that's the way to get it, and not through just sending it down to Washington to create the jobs through what Washington spends. There was another point that I would make.  I make it here recognizing that most of the people in this great audience are those that have had rare opportunities.  You have had the chance to go up in your communities, to go to school.  You have not suffered from discrimination or prejudice, the great majority of you.  And the reason I mention it to you, the reason that I think it's particularly appropriate to say it here is because I don't know of any man in this country who at the state level, and who also in his life, has done a more effective job, or one who has believed more deeply than Governor Nelson Rockefeller in the field of creating equal opportunities for all of our people.

"I remember my father in the last days he lived.  He had excellent medical care because we're fortunate that the medical care under our system is the best in the world, but his medical bills that year were over $2,000, and I know what a difficult thing it was for him and my mother to pay those bills.  That's why I feel deeply on this subject, deeply from that standpoint and deeply because I think in this country of ours we must find a way in which our older citizens can get the protection that they need when these disastrous diseases come upon them.",0,1793_12,1793_12
"I have one other issue to discuss.  I said that I would save it until the last because it was the most important.  You know what it is.  What could be more important than a job, than good schools and good housing?  What could be more important than these things?  Being around to enjoy them.",0,1793_24,1793_24
"So let's be sure, as we go into this stretch, we step up our campaign, that we step it up and also that we don't do it just with the """"""""hip hip hooray"""""""" of a meeting, but that we recognize it's going to be won right down there, won or lost in the battleground.  They know  it.  They're going to pour in, without any question, hundreds of thousands of paid workers, in many instances.  I say hundreds of thousands.  That may be an exaggeration.  There certainly will be thousands of paid workers in some of the key industrial states.  They will be poured into this campaign.  We've got to combat them with volunteers, because that's all we have, but a good volunteer worker can always beat a paid worker, if he works, and so I say let's outwork them and outfight them in these last three weeks, and we'll win Arizona and the nation.

"And I want to tell you why.  Because I believe in party responsibility; because I believe that it is not only necessary to elect a Republican president.  It's also necessary to build this party from top to bottom, and we cannot do it unless we all stand together right up and down the line.  And so that's why I do that.  Frankly, if the time ever comes when I'm not proud of my party and proud of the candidates I'm running with, then, of course, the thing for me to do is to get out of the party.",0,1799_8,1799_8
"So I can only say, since I don't intend that, I'm going to continue to support every Republican candidate in this state and also in the nation, and do it proudly because we simply have to develop a spirit--a spirit which you already have in this state, a spirit which also developed in other states as well, a spirit that will rebuild our strength, and it is coming back. Now, the last thing I would say is this campaign has brought out the biggest crowds of any I have ever participated in.  I think it's probably the record.  Crowds from the standpoint of any campaign, including the ones in 1952 and 1956, are enthusiastic.  People believe there is a cause worth fighting for and working for and voting for, and we can win this election.  ",0,1799_9,1799_9
"Now I know that there are those here who approve that record.  I know there are those who criticize as does my opponent.  Let's get one thing clear.  All the criticism in the world of the Eisenhower record in the field of foreign policy isn't going to fool the American people because they know what it is and they like it.  They know that in 1953, when Eisenhower became president, we were in a war.  They know that in these last seven and a half years we got this nation out of one war, we've kept her out of others, and we do have peace without surrender today and they want to continue that kind of leadership.",0,1801_8,1801_8
"This means we can never be satisfied with what we're doing because the situation changes, we've got to take advantage of new inventions as they come along, we've got to step up our defense forces as the Soviet Union moves in new directions, we've got to be sure that the time never comes that an American President is at a conference table where the man on the other side of the table says """"""""I'm stronger than you are and I can blackmail you.""""""""  And so, one, we will keep America strong militarily, and the second thing we will do is this.  We will be firm in our diplomacy.  We know this man as I emphasized.  We know that he doesn't react like the leaders of the free world.  We know that the naive and well-intentioned people who suggest that a concession here or a concession there will lead to peace forget the lessons of history.  My friends, we learned in Korea, we learned in dealing with Hitler, that whenever you're confronted with a dictator the way to peace is to strengthen strength and firmness, and the way to war is through weakness, both militarily and diplomatically.  We stand for strength and firmness and that's what we're going to continue, and that's what the American people are going to vote for on November 8th. ",0,1802_9,1802_9
"That strength we must maintain.  Why?  Not because we are for war, because we are not; because we are for peace, because we are the guardians of peace, and because it is essential that as guardians of peace, America must have strength that will discourage any of those who would threaten the peace of the world--and I can assure you that decisions which will be made if I have the opportunity to make them, will be ones that will always put the security of America first.  That must come before any other consideration, and there will never be a dollar sign on what Americans will be able to do in the field of protecting the defense of this country.",0,1805_6,1805_6

"Now, let's look at the economic factors for just a moment.  We've been hearing that America has been standing still, and it's said we've got to change our economic policies so that America can get going again, so that we can cross some new frontiers.  Well, my friends just let me say this: Anybody who says America has been standing still during the Eisenhower years just hasn't been traveling around America.  He's been traveling in some other country, I can tell you that, because look at this area; look at the state of Florida, the growth here in the last eight years.  I say that those who say America is standing still are making a fatal error.  They are judging the growth of America by what government does rather than what people do, and it's people who make America great, not just simply what government does at the federal or the state or the local level.",0,1807_18,1807_18
"Incidentally, I have been thinking up to this time about how much easier this campaign would be if I could have the mayor's speech writer, and Cardinal Spellman as my finance chairman. I also, incidentally, have been thinking a great deal about what would be appropriate for me to say of a nonpolitical nature, what would be appropriate to say and still be true to my own conscience.  Of course, I expect attacks in campaigns.  One has been made upon me of which I have to take some recognition at this dinner.  It was not made tonight, but made previously.  I hesitate to do it.  It is of such a serious nature however, that I think before this particular audience what I consider to be one of the worst smears in American political history has got to be nailed.",0,1808_4,2004-08-12-remarks-carson-california_4
"Now, going along with this faith in the individual as an abiding concern, a concern for his problems as a human being--the possible loss of a job and livelihood through no fault of his own when the economy changes; the fear that the end of his working years may mean poverty, that the loss of a breadwinner may mean destitution for the widow and children; the cost of medical care in old age: these are some of the searing human concerns that our program aims to minimize through effective private and public measures. Such efforts toward personal security, first, are right--not only from the humanitarian viewpoint, which all of us will understand--they are mandatory if our complex modern society is to work at its best, at its fullest.  They are essential to our purpose.  And what is that purpose?  I think, summed up in a sentence, it is this: we must lift the ceiling over personal opportunity.  We must strengthen the floor over the pit of personal disaster.  Public policy, therefore, should seek to put right what is wrong in our America, but it should also seek to strengthen what is right.  It should recognize the plain fact that Americans are proud and self-reliant individuals.  Programs that encourage individuals to depend on government are wrong, for increasing dependence by a people upon government is not a sign of strength; it is a sign of weakness, and in this day of competition with the Communists, Americans must be sturdy and strong.",0,1809_12,1809_12
"To find and develop talent in America and thus avoid the waste of a potentially superior scientist, engineer, teacher, minister, or doctor, we need also a program in the field of education, an intensified one.  We must widen opportunities for all.  We must improve the quality of educational effort.  We must enhance the status of our teachers.  To that end, I have proposed a national program in support of education, emphasizing such elements as college scholarships for those who cannot under any circumstances afford to borrow and to pay back, tax credits or deductions to cover tuition and other costs of higher education, aid in school construction to provide needed facilities, and thereby to release local funds for raising teachers' salaries--all of this, however, particularly at the secondary and primary level, to be accomplished without compromising local controls of our school system.",0,1809_17,1809_17
"So, on this score I say, the American people raise a doubt. The second point: we come to the Paris conference.  The Paris conference, you remember, was the one that Mr. Khrushchev broke up.  He said he broke it up at the time because the President had ordered the U-2 flights, you recall, which were ordered to protect the security of the United States, to get information about whether there was a surprise attack being mounted against the United States, and at that time Mr. Khrushchev demanded that the President of the United States apologize or express regrets for those flights.  The President of the United States refused.",0,1810_11,1810_11
"The way to move forward is for government to encourage the American people to develop to the full the tremendous abilities they have--and, believe me, we have the program that will do it.  We will produce again in all of these areas, in which America wants progress.  But one other point I would make: we will do it not with programs that will raise your taxes, that will raise your prices, and theirs will.  And let me say to every housewife here: if you vote for our opponents, the prices of everything you buy in the grocery store will go up because of their farm program, incidentally, that won't help the farmer either; but it will certainly have that effect, and they know it.  Other prices will go up, and I say, my friends, that the American people want higher wages, yes; they want prosperity, yes; but they want it without inflation, and without war, and that's the kind we produce, and that's the kind you want.",0,1815_8,1815_8
"So, you've got to think of that.  If you want higher taxes, if you want higher prices, you have a pretty good choice and a pretty good way to get them.  No, I say, we can have progress and that we will have it, but that the way to get it is not through programs which, in effect, will say, """"Turn over all these problems to the Federal Government.  Let us have your money and we'll spend it for you."""" The way to progress is for the Federal Government to do what it ought to do and what it needs to do, but not to spend a dollar that can be spent better by the people themselves at home right here in Marietta, Ohio.",0,1818_8,3116_23

He has always made it clear that the United States is not going to surrender principle or territory any place in the world.",0,1824_6,1550_2
"The last point that I want to make is one that I know all of you will particularly understand.  As I look over a crowd like this, as I realize the inconvenience and the discomfort that was caused to you to have to come here, it makes me know what a tremendous and awesome responsibility it is even to be running for president and even to be thinking of the possibility of being president of this country. I can only tell you that, as see this crowd, I will never forget this day in Marion.  I will remember the people who came here, who stood in the rain and who looked at me, listened to what I have to say, and if you believe, and if your verdict will be, that I am the one to serve you, I want you to know that I will do everything in my power in working for a better America, an America in which we can all move forward together, leaving none behind, an America in which the young people of this country will have greater opportunities than we have even had in our time, and a world in which all men can be free, in which we can live in peace.",0,1827_8,2075_21

This campaign is one in which I ask you to vote not as Republicans, not as Democrats, or Independents, but as Americans, thinking of what this nation needs and what the world needs in the years ahead.   I say this because I have seen the world, because I have had the opportunity to know the problems with which we are confronted, and because I know that the decisions that the next president makes may determine the difference between whether we have peace or war, between whether we have freedom, for ourselves and for the whole world: therefore, I urge all of you to consider the qualifications of the candidates on the basis not simply of the labels you may wear, but on the basis of whether you think what we stand for is best for America.",0,1835_2,1835_2

"It wouldn't cost me much.  After all, it's not my money, or his, but yours we would be spending; but that's the whole point of the exercise.  The reason why I stand for programs that will produce progress, but cost less, about $15 billion a year less of the federal government's money, and that's your money, is that I know what it means when the federal government spends more than it takes in.  I know the difficulty that literally hundreds of thousands, millions of families, are having meeting their obligations today.  I know that if my opponent's programs are enacted into law, it will mean higher prices.  It will mean higher taxes, or both, for the American people.",0,1848_22,1848_22

And, of course, the answer is: being alive is more important.",0,1848_26,1848_26

And, incidentally, that's the same situation here in Illinois.  You know what boss rule means with the Cook County gang up there.  You don't want any part of it.

But, my friends, I can assure you of this: we are not, under any circumstances, going to enter into any agreements with the Soviet leaders which would surrender freedom any place in the world, because that leads to war and not to peace.

My friends, you either have to raise taxes or you have to have deficit financing, which means raising prices, or he has to give up part of his programs--and he should tell the American people the truth. What is he going to do--one of these three things? It's time that he told.",0,1857_15,2052_10

Your choice at home is to move forward, to move forward to the greatest progress that America has ever had, to move forward to better schools and better housing, to move forward in an attack on our farm problems, and all the others that exist in this country, but to move forward in freedom, not attacking the frontiers of freedom, to move forward in the way that Americans want to move, to move forward without inflation. And then you have the choice, on the other side, of going backward, going backward on a road paved with glittering promises, but a road that leads to economic disaster for the American people and the American economy.",0,1858_21,1858_21

"So I say to you today, in introducing him, it is well to keep the record straight, and as we flew by helicopter over New York and up to this great area here and the plane landed, it occurred to me I could think of no better answer to one of the silliest comments that has been made by our opponents during the course of this campaign, and that is that America has stood still for seven years and now we've got to get her going again. Well, believe me, anybody who says America is standing still hasn't been traveling through America--I can assure you of that--as I have.  Look at this great area here. It was built in the last seven years: shopping centers, highways, three times as many schools, more housing, more hospitals, the greatest progress in civil rights not only in this administration--more than in the previous twenty years, more than in eighty years. My friends we can be proud not only that President Eisenhower has restored dignity and decency to the presidency, but that he has led America to the greatest progress we've ever had in our history.

I was delighted, too, prior to the time of coming on the stage, to hear you welcome enthusiastically my colleagues who are candidates on my party's ticket in this state. I particularly want to mention my friend, John Tower. You know, I have a pretty good deal of experience in seeing candidates, and I've seen a lot of candidates for the Senate around the country, Democrat and Republican. I will say that there is no candidate that I have seen who, from the standpoint of experience, background, and courage, is more qualified to be a U.S. senator from Texas than John Tower.

"So, here are three instances where he first said one thing and then said something else. My friends, suppose he had been president. You know what would have happened? I've been there. I've been there when the President made great decisions. I remember the morning we went into Lebanon. I remember the President pacing the floor of the oval room in the White House. It was a terrible decision for any man to make, even for a man used to great decisions, because the President knew that if he went in it risked war. He knew that if he didn't go in war would probably be sure because the Communists would sweep down through the Middle East. So, finally, he turned to me. He said, """"We have got to go in."""" We went in. That was one of at least ten decisions made in this administration which could have resulted in war if somebody who was rash, somebody who was impulsive, somebody who was inexperienced, had been sitting there in the White House.",0,1870_34,3299_38
"Now, why do I say this decision is bigger than the Republican party and bigger than the Democratic party? I say it because this year, 1960, we are electing not only the leader of America, but the leader of the free world. This year, 1960, we elect a man who will determine what will happen in the United States, but also who will determine what will happen in the world, and I say it is not enough simply to vote on the basis of how your father voted or your grandfather voted or the label you may wear. What we must do is to put America first and the party second--and that is best for us and best for America. ",0,1870_6,1870_6
"But, getting back to the issues before us, I suggest that we consider them tonight in terms of what you want from your government in Washington, D.C. I think the first thing that everybody would say he wanted from the government in Washington could be summed up in one word: the word """"progress."""" We Americans are a go-ahead people. We're never satisfied with things as they are. That's why we're a great people. That's why, as a matter of fact, California is one of the greatest states, because our people have always been progressive. We wanted to move forward.",0,1871_3,1871_3
"And I say in this instance we have three indications from my opponent, when the chips were down, in the course of this campaign, would have made the wrong decision--and I ask you: can we use the White House, in effect, as a training school where a man gets experience at the expense of the American people? I do not suggest to you that if I am elected I will not make mistakes. I do only say, however, that I know what these problems are. I do say that, having been through the fire of decision, as I described it, I do believe that in these years ahead I can avoid some of the mistakes that might come from rashness, from shooting from the hip, from impulsiveness.",0,1871_35,2758_9
"The same thing happened when we got to the Alamo in San Antonio a little later in the day. The same thing happened in Houston last night--not only the biggest crowd ever in Houston, but it was probably the greatest night rally of this campaign which has been held by either candidate, from the reports I have received. Then we came in at the airport at 11 o'clock last night. I know, because I didn't get much sleep last night. Neither did you if you were at the airport. There was a massive crowd with flashlights welcoming us. It was a sight we will never forget.",0,1872_1,1872_1
"And then, my friends, the third point, you will recall if you heard our last debate, was on Cuba where he said the President wasn't going far enough, and where he, in effect, advocated policies that were universally interpreted as meaning intervention in the affairs of Cuba. And what would that have meant? It would have invited the very kind of intervention from abroad that could have brought war to this hemisphere and to the world.",0,1874_32,1874_32
"My friends, have no doubt about it. America is not only the strongest country in the world militarily and the strongest country in the world economically, but more than that, America is honored in the world--and I'll tell you why. I have been to fifty-four countries. We are honored not because we're strong, but because we stand for and believe in the right things. You know what they are? Our faith in God, our belief in the rights of men, our belief that the rights men have to freedom and to equality of opportunity do not come from men, but that they come from God and, therefore, cannot be taken away by men; our belief that nations have a right to be independent, that men have a right to be free.",0,1874_37,1874_37

"As far as Rampart Canyon Dam is concerned, certainly you can expect progress, more progress, I believe, in our administration than his, because it's always the same old story. They make the promises, but we produce on the promises that they make--and that's what we want.  Now, a third point that I want to make has to do with the development of this great state. You know, the easy thing to do is to come to a state like this and say to you: the federal government is going to take over all of your problems. The federal government is going to promise you this, that, and the other thing. As a matter of fact, it's rather interesting that when we look at this campaign, it's had a rather amusing twist in a sense because, as you notice, the slogan that our opposition is using: """"""""Kennedy is the remedy."""""""" Well, you know, that's like the old medicine man who used to come to town--the same remedy for everything--spend more money--and that's your money. Now, the difference was, you know, that the medicine man had the same remedy--different labels on the bottle--it would cure snakebite or """"""""rheumatism"""""""" or anything else, but it really didn't do it; and the difference was the medicine man always got out of town just before the people caught up with the fact that the remedy didn't work.

In 2002, I set a clear goal, 5.5 million new minority homeowners by the end of the decade. And in just 2 years, more than 1.6 million minorities have become homeowners.

I submit that this election year must bring a national referendum on this issue of human rights and we must turn away from the old era that all of you know too well, of segregation and discrimination which never gave us much except trouble, and we must choose the new day of community, of integration, and of opportunity, and we must turn away from the old era when an American soldier who fought in an integrated Army would come home into a neighborhood of segregation and slumism.

He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes. In fact, I think there's a strong probability he hasn't paid federal taxes a lot of years.

It has been said ofthis nation that we are not a long-distance runner but a nation ofsprinters.  I hope not.  But in the year twenty-five of the nuclear age, wemust finally learn that peace will never be a short-run game butalways a marathon.

But there are those who feel that this process can be destroyed. Censorship is not by government alone.  Sometimes censorship is when people close their minds.  Sometimes, it is when people decide that others should not have the right to be heard.  Sometimes it is when people decide that they will so conduct themselves as to cause disarray in public gathering.  Censorship is evil in any of its forms.  Those who would first destroy the meaning of democracy are those who first seek to destroy the functioning of the democratic process.

These, and there may be others, are all responsible for, in part for what has happened, because as it was noted, it takes time and it takes perseverance.  And I am happy to say that in my 16 years in the Senate, I do not recall a single time that I ever voted against a development project for our rivers.

These are some of the urgent questions we all must answer--first as citizens, then as leaders of government. For at every level of government--local, state, and federal--elected and appointed officials have the duty to listen before they have the right to lead. They do not own the public schools. These schools belong to the people who paid to build them and who pay to support them. And I believe that government has not been listening well enough lately.

I consider education a federal concern, a state responsibility and a local function. The federal government, with its ability to raise funds on a national basis, should aim at reducing the discrepancies among the various states in their resources for the support of education. State government must bear the legal responsibility of setting standards for attendance, teacher certification, per-pupil expenditure and the development of long range plans.

This does not necessarily mean there will be war. It does mean that the diplomacy requirements of the United States must be infinitely greater if we are to avoid it.

I am not going to permit any cuts in the military defense of this country that in any way jeopardize our national security, but I don't want us to forget the warning that the late President Eisenhower gave us eleven years ago when he said that if the military takes more than it needs it actually weakens the country by depriving us of resources that we need to strengthen our health and our schools and our housing and those other things that make up the conditions of national security and national strength.  Now we need a powerful military force but we also need to remember that the great foundation of this nation is based on the health of our people and the quality of our lives and the unity of our homes and our neighborhoods and our communities. We have got to recognize in the decade of the 1970s that whatever the danger is from Hanoi, or Peking or Moscow, those dangers do not present as immediate a threat to the lives and well-being of our people as do the mounting problems of crime and drug addiction and joblessness and bad housing and pollution and all of those things that are making life almost unlivable here in our own society.",0,2270_5,2270_5

First of all, the farmer who grew the wheat and sold it at a lower price than would otherwise have been the case had he had the information that was given to these grain traders. Secondly, the taxpayers financed it--not by subsidies to the grain farmers, but to the export subsidies that went to the tune of more than $100 million beyond what could be justified to the great grain exporting companies. And now we read on yesterday that these grain speculators want to crawl through an unjustified loophole in the tax law known as the Disc System that would exempt 50% of these windfall profits from any tax at all. I want to say here that these fellows are not grain sharks--they are hogs. They want it all. This is just one example of the kinds of special interest domination of this administration that has characterized it from the very first.

I bet not 1 percent of the people in this room had ever heard my name. We began campaigning just like you would if you wanted to be president. My wife and I and my children and a few volunteers began going from one home to another. And we would invite all the neighbors to come into the living room and meet with us--sometimes three or four people would show up. We'd go into a labor hall that would hold up to two to three hundred folks, and maybe ten people would come, and we'd stand in factory shift lines, and nobody knew why I was there or who I was. And by the time I explained, """"""""I'm Jimmy Carter from Georgia, I'm running for president,"""""""" they were already gone. We walked into beauty parlors and barber shops and restaurants, and on the streets and factory shift lines, later on, shopping centers, farmers' markets, livestock sales barns, city halls, county court houses. We talked a little. And we listened a lot. In New Hampshire and Florida, and Illinois and North Carolina, and all over the country. We had thirty primaries where you could win delegates. And I was in all of them. I didn't win them all. But because my base and my support was from the people, we built up a campaign organization that made history in presidential campaign politics in our country. Long before the convention even met, I had won the nomination of the Democratic party. Most of the delegates who went there for me had never been involved in politics before.

"The first step in providing economic equality for women is to ensure a stable national economy in which every person who wants to work can have a job, and in which the wages derived from that labor are not ravaged by quiet, undetected, insidious inflation. Furthermore, within that stable economy, it is necessary to eliminate all forms of sexual discrimination and to provide women, for the first time in history, with economic opportunities equal to those of men. A spokesman for the Ford Administration made an amazing comment before a group of businessmen in Colorado in August of this year. In attempting to rationalize away the rising unemployment rates which have now reached 7.9 percent (with 500,000 more Americans going on the unemployment rolls in the last three months alone), this man argued that unemployment was not really an issue because the rate for male heads of households was only 5.5 percent.

There are three hundred thousand Soviet troops in Eastern Europe; there are two divisions in Poland. There are three or four divisions in Czechoslovakia. Eight years after the Soviet Union had promised to remove them. There are fifteen divisions in Eastern Germany. They are now building an even stronger Berlin Wall.

Although we've recently not lived up to ideals, I know of no great nation in history that has more often conducted itself in a moral, unselfish, generous manner abroad, and provided more freedom and opportunity to its own citizens at home. Still, in recent years, we've had reason to be troubled. We've stumbled into the quagmires of Vietnam, and Cambodia, and Chile, and Cyprus, and we've responded inadequately to human suffering that we've recognized in places like Bangladesh, Burundi, and the Sahel area of northern Africa. In other undeveloped and struggling and sometimes starving nations we've allowed virtually unlimited sales of American weapons overseas. As I said in the debate the other night, we've become the arms merchant of the world. This is a policy that's both cynical and dangerous. That we've in effect condoned the efforts of some Arab countries to circumvent the commitment of our Bill of Rights and boycott American businesses who trade with Israel or who have Jewish owners or managers within the businesses themselves.

I can't express my gratitude deeply enough. It has been a super day--the State Fair, a great football game, and then this great rally.",0,2463_0,2012-09-25-event-vandalia-ohio_25
"I want the American people to understand the profound differences between us in areas of policy as well as philosophy. Therefore, I intend to fight Mr. Carter on the issues with all the ability I can command. The challenges before us are immense if we are to successfully defend the principles of freedom and independence we celebrate this Bicentennial Year. The free world looks to us as the last best hope for preserving this heritage. To be successful we must be strong. The fact is we are, and I intend to assure that in this critical hour America remains the strong, steady defender of freedom for all humanity.",0,2465_7,2465_7
"But let me take just a few minutes. When I was here on the Fourth of July to see the Tall Ships, more beautiful sails came to this city, I think, than ever in the history of any city or any nation. There was promise, conviction, and hometown pride. It was clearly demonstrated by anybody who came to the city on that occasion. And that new spirit--as we flew over in the helicopter or in our aircraft--that new spirit was demonstrated. It was hard earned, and it was well deserved, and I congratulate you all.",0,2468_9,2468_9
"I am a candidate for the presidency because I have a deep conviction and faith, a deep inward feeling that the American people want to go the direction we want to take them. And, therefore, I come to the great state of New Jersey to ask for your help and your support. New Jersey is a key state. New Jersey can make the difference whether we have enough electoral votes on November 2nd to win.",0,2474_18,2474_18
"Third, Mr. Carter proposed putting a tax on all church properties other than the church building itself. He wants to tax church-supported schools, church-supported hospitals, church-supported orphanages, and church-supported retirement homes. Those activities are just as much a part of the church's work as the physical place of worship, and we shouldn't let him get away with that kind of a tax policy.",0,2474_6,2474_6
But I'm especially pleased to have the opportunity to recognize the contributions of many valiant Americans of Polish and Czech ancestry who fought for freedom. I think this legislation that I'm signing today provides that any person who served during World War I or World War II as a member of any armed force of the government of Czechoslovakia or Poland and participated while so serving in armed conflict with an enemy of the United States shall by virtue of such service be entitled to certain medical benefits. This legislation requires that each person who is so entitled shall have been a citizen of the United States for at least ten years.,1,2475_1,2518_19
"One other point: I think we've got to put the lid on federal spending. Jimmy Carter has embraced sixty-some spending programs that will add $100 billion to $200 billion annually to the federal expenditure. Jimmy Carter also says he wants to reorganize the federal government. Let me point this out: When he was Governor of the state of Georgia, four years, he increased the number of state employees by 25 percent or more; he increased the spending by the state of Georgia by 50 percent or more; he increased the bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia by over $200 million. Can you trust him with that record to reorganize the federal government? I don't think you can.",0,2479_7,1946_37
"Good morning. Betty and I are delighted to be in the great state of Illinois, in particular in Bloomington and McLean County. Thank you very much.",0,2480_0,2480_0
"So, this record of trust, prosperity, and peace, I lay alongside the record of Jimmy Carter and his promises. And Jimmy Carter, it seems to me, as he goes from one part of the country to the other, says anything, anywhere, to get to be president of the United States. When Jimmy Carter is in California, he tries to sound like Cesar Chavez. When Jimmy Carter is in Chicago, he tries to sound like Mayor Daley. When Jimmy Carter is in New York, he tries to sound like Bella Abzug. And when he comes to this great farm land of Illinois, he tries to sound like just a little old peanut farmer. He wanders, he wavers, he wiggles, and he waffles. I think the American people deserve better than that.",0,2480_4,3300_14
"Now, what does Jimmy Carter want to do? A few weeks ago he had an interview with the Associated Press--I almost said another interview--but he had this interview with the Associated Press, and he said that he would be in favor of increasing taxes for all people of medium income or above. That means that 50 percent of the taxpayers of this country would get a tax increase. Boy, I like that reaction. Jerry Ford wants to give you tax relief. Jimmy Carter wants to increase your taxes. Who do you want for president? Keep it going. Keep it going.",0,2485_11,2012-10-05-st-petersburg-florida_7
"One reason U.S. commercial airlines have been unable to meet FAA noise standards is that some airlines could not afford to because of the outmoded regulatory approach of the Civil Aeronautics Board. A year ago, I proposed aviation regulatory reform to make airline service more competitive and thereby improve service to passengers, reduce fares, and strengthen the financial condition of the airlines. Congress refused to pass that legislation, which would have made it possible for the airlines to modify or to replace their noisy jet aircraft.",0,2487_4,2487_4
"We have our problems, but in the last two troubled years we've come a long, long way. Our long national nightmare is over; four million new jobs have been created in less than two years; inflation cut more than half; trust has been restored in the White House; America is at peace. At home as well as abroad; we are putting our old angers aside; we are putting our old problems behind us and healing our wounds.",0,2492_19,2492_19
"While I am here, let me extend a very special invitation to come to Washington next January for the inauguration of Jerry Ford and Bob Dole; or to put it another way, y'all come.  In Kansas City, I knew I had picked an outstanding teammate or running mate. Bob Dole has a superb record, not only in the House of Representatives but in the United States Senate. But I didn't really understand that I got such a big dividend when we got Libby Dole with Bob Dole, and thank you very much.",0,2492_3,2492_3
"My idea of tax reform is tax reduction. I'm sure you recall that I submitted to the Congress a proposal to increase the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000. That is meaningful tax reduction to the long shortchanged middle-income taxpayers. Congress didn't pass it, but I make a pledge to you: I'm going to keep the pressure on the next Congress until they do, and if they don't, they'll hear about it in the next election.",0,2492_7,2492_7
"I would also like to express my deep, personal appreciation to the master of ceremonies, Peter Graves, who went with us in Illinois, who was with us in California. Thank you very, very much, Peter. In this process, you get some experience on bands. Well, let me say that the Bellevue Band, the Queen Anne Band, and the Everett Band--they're all first class.",0,2502_1,2502_1
"Nothing was more inspirational to me than that wonderful Fourth of July, when America celebrated its Bicentennial. I found all over America--and it was reported by the news media, I think, with great enthusiasm because it showed a change--America was healed, America was on the move, and we all look forward to a great opportunity to do the things in the next four and the next 100 years that must be done to make that vision of our forefathers a reality. So, I thank Edith. She has taken on the leadership with two others, George Feldman and Dom DiMaggio, to get all the Independents and Democrats who feel, as I do, that this country does have an opportunity to do those wonderful things that our forefathers gave us the opportunity to do. I just couldn't come to Oregon and get a finer display of the kind of support that I want, and I thank each and every one of them from the bottom of my heart.",0,2503_2,2503_2
"Q. This may seem like a broadcaster question, but it's really a public interest one in a way, and I know you're a sports fan. We've had a recent example here of where Home Box Office, a pay cable organization, was able to outbid local stations or an interested network in the NIT tournaments. And in a very short period of time it's estimated--perhaps in two or three years--pay cable is going to be able, due to its affluence and income, to outbid networks and local stations for much of the top and choice programming, including sports. And I'd like to ask you what your view is on the siphoning of free broadcast programming to pay cable?",0,2505_19,2505_19

"There have been some misjudgments. Sometimes we have made commitments that exceeded our capabilities. Sometimes we have been heavy-handed. But the record of achievement far, far exceeds that of failure.",0,2507_2,2507_2
"So, in the budget that I submitted last January for congressional consideration reduced that rate of growth by 50 percent or a rate of growth of 5 1/2 percent. We made some headway. The Congress added about $18 billion over the actual dollars that I recommended for the budget for the current fiscal year, but that is better than they have been doing over the last ten years.",0,2507_34,2257_15
"One of the most significant achievements of this administration is that we have now reversed that slide. And as long as I am president we are going to have an Army, a Navy, an Air Force, and a Marine Corps that are unsurpassed in military capability. I know it is very costly. As President Eisenhower once said, and I quote, """"""""A good defense is never a cheap defense,"""""""" end quote. But for the sake of peace and freedom we must be willing to make the sacrifices that maintain America's military might.",0,2507_8,2507_8
"In every field America is on the move. We are on the march. We made an incredible comeback in the past two years and we are not through yet. You can believe me when I say this nation is sound, this nation is secure. This nation is on the way to a better quality of life for all Americans, and this administration has earned the trust of the American people for the next four years.",0,2508_7,2508_7
"Now, let me say, we have faced the worst recession in the last forty years in the last eighteen months. We have had unemployment that was far too high. But, at the same time let me say on the affirmative side we have created four million more jobs and we have eighty-eight million American people working today--an all-time high--and we have achieved this not by dead-end taxpayer-paid jobs, but by jobs primarily in the private sector where five out of the six jobs are today. And as we move ahead in the next few months under the Ford administration, we are going to have more jobs. We are going to have more jobs in the private sector, because we are going to stimulate the economy with tax reductions for you and for business. And that is the way we are going to make America prosperous, the way you want it.",0,2513_13,2513_13
"But also, we need to make certain that our younger generation has a quality education. The federal government does contribute to local and state educational programs. But I was dumbfounded just the other day to find that there are 110 different federal educational programs. If you can, imagine how many bureaucrats in Washington are managing 110 educational programs.",0,2518_19,1343_10
"I don't think that you can cut the Defense Department, as some suggest, and have our military capability unsurpassed. To deter aggression, to meet any challenge, to protect our national security, I believe that the president of the United States has an obligation to see to it that the necessary funds are there to buy the best weapons, to have the best leadership, to have the best training, to have the strength that adversaries respect and allies appreciate. Then America can keep the peace that we have and be the leader in the world, and we will under this administration.",0,2518_26,2518_26

It robs their savings, their purchasing power, and everybody else's.",0,2519_14,2519_14

"I think all of you know that it costs money for us to have the best Army, the best Navy, the best Air Force, and the best Marine Corps. But let me say, the fact that we are number one encourages our allies to stand tall and strong with us and, at the same time, is a warning to our adversaries they hadn't better try to fool around with America.

"I charged that committee with developing a sound fiscal policy, a sound federal policy to help preserve our neighborhoods. That policy will be based on local initiative and local control, and I will see that that policy is carried out over the next four years. I am deeply aware of another issue that troubles many of you, especially those of you from Eastern Europe.

It is living from Cleveland to Rocky River, to Parma and North Royalton, to Richmond Heights, to Shaker Heights, to Garfield Heights. Gosh, I can't think of all the other communities. But they are all wonderful communities in this great state of Ohio, and it is similar, I am sure, in all the communities throughout the United States. And I am proud to say that as long as I am president, I will do all that I possibly can to keep that wonderful spirit alive.",0,2524_4,2524_4
"Throughout my time as president, I have shaped our foreign policy according to four basic principles: First, we have sought to maintain America's unquestioned military strength. One of the most significant achievements of this administration is that, after a decade in which Congress slashed a total of $50 billion from defense budgets, we reversed that downward trend. And we have finally convinced the Congress to stop shortchanging America's defense. As long as I am president, we will have an Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps unsurpassed in military capability.",0,2525_1,2525_1

Half way around the world, they can sell American-made steel rods, made up of scrap material that used to be sent overseas to China, with a competitive advantage over the same steel rods made a few hundred miles away in Japan.

And when our nation raises high the banner of human rights, the breath of freedom is expanded in the hearts of those who haven't known it in the past. And when they see us with a democratic system working, as it is now in this election season, it makes the attractions of democracy and freedom even more valuable to others.

I was at Milt and Roslyn's home, the Embassy in Austria, when we negotiated the SALT II treaty. Eisenhower was for nuclear arms control. All the Republican presidents since then were for nuclear arms control. Every Democratic President since Truman have been for nuclear arms control. To give up the thought that we could have so-called nuclear superiority--because when you adopt a policy of nuclear superiority, it means that you cannot negotiate mutual and balanced restraints or reductions--and for us to abandon the hope or the prospect of having nuclear weapons controlled in our own country, in the Soviet Union, and particularly among those nations that don't have nuclear weapons yet, that is indeed a radical departure in the prospects for peace in the future.",0,2558_9,2558_9

This year every day we are importing two million barrels of foreign oil less than we did the first year I was in the White House--a sustained protection of our nation's economy and also our nation's security, because anyone who thinks will know that we are not free to exercise our foreign policy if we should become subject to blackmail from foreign oil suppliers. And to achieve our energy security is an important commitment of this nation. It's one that I've exemplified. It's one that the nation has responded with effectiveness.",0,2575_11,2575_11

I went into the law office of a young black legislator in Savannah, Georgia, when I was running for governor in 1970, and he had a photograph on his wall that told the story in vivid terms. It was a photograph of a white person standing in the criminal docket as the accused, and the judge was black, and all twelve jurors were black, and the sheriff was black, and the bailiff was black, and all those in audience in the court were black. I think that impressed me more than any photograph or even public demonstration that I've ever seen.",1,2576_6,2576_6

Four years ago, Tennesseans helped to get me a good job in the city and to keep me in the White House for this last four years. You came in second to Georgia in the strength of the vote that I got here in the general election, and I'd like to know if you think you might even beat Georgia in 1980. How about that?

The Democrats supported that minimum wage; the Republicans were against it. Now we have a sound minimum wage program in our country, and my Republican opponent says that there's been more hardship and suffering brought about by minimum wage than we got from the Great Depression. He also says that unemployment compensation, so vital to a nation when temporary unemployment comes, my opponent said that unemployment compensation is just a free paid vacation for freeloaders. This is the kind of attitude toward working people that's contrary to the basic concepts of the South and contrary to the basic concepts of our nation.

People in every community almost in the entire world look on her, epitomizing in a highly publicized but very personal way the meaning of a family and the meaning of faith and the meaning of confidence and the meaning of deep religious convictions that never change. Frank Manning, my mother, Mrs. Rose Kennedy are more famous than a lot of people. But they are examples of the courage and the commitment and the worth to our country of tens of millions of people just like you: men and women who, after they reach retirement age--and we've raised the mandatory retirement age, as you know, very much, and I think we might raise it some more--have a chance to start a new life in many ways, new interests, to make new friends, to continue to grow.",0,2588_4,2894_4

That's important. My Republican opponent has called for the injection of American military forces repeatedly into trouble spots around the world--North Korea, Ecuador, Angola, Rhodesia, Cyprus. You might say that's ancient history, he's changed--this year, Cuba, Pakistan, the Middle East.

One of the most vivid memories in my mind is 1968. The Republicans nominated Richard Nixon for president. The Democrats nominated Hubert Humphrey for president. Many people, as you well remember, had been for Senator Gene McCarthy, and when Hubert Humphrey got the nomination to replace Lyndon Johnson as president, a lot of Democrats said, """"""""Hubert Humphrey's not perfect. I'm not going to help him. Let him shift for himself."""""""" So Hubert Humphrey never went to serve in the Oval Office; Richard Nixon did.

If you put fifty tons of TNT in each one of a series of railroad cars, the train would be over two hundred miles long and would require four hundred diesel engines to pull it--one megaton.

"The enormous responsibility of this duty and challenge is perhaps the preeminent issue in the 1980 election, a radical departure from the policies and beliefs and commitments of presidents who preceded me in the Oval Office ever since the Second World War. It's important for our nation to have an energy policy in the future that steadily removes our dependence upon and our potential subservience to the Arab OPEC nations for our oil supplies. In 1979 OPEC increased the price of oil more than the oil prices had been increased since oil was first discovered in the 1800's.

And we can sell all the American coal we can transport to a port and load on a ship.

We have a national emergency in Michigan today and there are steps our government should be taking. It is impossible to campaign across this great country without being angered that hundreds of thousands of Americans are out of work in our automobile and supplier-related industries. To say these industries are in recession is to greatly understate the situation. These industries and the areas of the country where they are represented are in a depression of national-emergency level.

"I don't expect him to answer the challenge, of course, because he continues to remain silent on the major economic issues confronting the American people. I suggest he is silent because he has no answers to the problems his policies have created. By contrast, a Reagan-Bush administration will be able to reverse the decline in Americans' standard of living, and we will begin working to do this our first day in office. Last month, I offered a comprehensive economic program geared at reducing the growth in federal spending, in taxes, in regulation, and in the money supply, and restoring predictability and stability to economic policy. These are steps this administration has utterly refused to take, but they will form the foundation of the Reagan-Bush economic plan. And when we carry out these steps, we will be able to gradually reduce inflation and unemployment at the same time. That way, we can restore the dream to Americans of a continually improving standard of living.",0,2676_10,2676_10

Part of that great spirit of idealism was captured by John F. Kennedy in 1960 when he called for creation of the Peace Corps.

And I don't have to tell you we didn't have any money.  And the only way I got through law school was the GI Bill.  And I have paid the federal government back three or four or five times over from the higher income I earned as a result of the fact I was able to get through law school.  And I don't regret a single penny of it.  And I believe in the integrity of our educational system.  It is so fundamental to our civilization.  It is so fundamental to the objectives of our society that it is a shared public responsibility that we support them through revenues and support through the governing bodies of these different institutions.

"Secondly, to try to help provide the pay that teachers need that makes it possible to be a teacher without deep sacrifice to yourself and your family.  The average teacher in America today starts at about $14,000 or $13,000 a year.  In some states it's far less.  I was in Florida a year ago, and I saw a teacher's schedule that showed a teacher who had twenty years of teaching with a doctorate degree made $17,000 a year.  I may be off a couple thousand, but I remember being shocked by the figure.  I have talked to any number of young people who went into teaching full of hope and found out they just couldn't stick with it, couldn't afford it.  I talked to a young man in New Hampshire.  I don't think he voted for me based on the returns, but we had a nice conversation.  He told me that, more than anything, he wanted to be a science teacher.  But he had a family of two kids, he was now thirty-six years of age.  He said, """"""""I couldn't do it.  I had to get out.  And I made double or triple whatever it was in the private sector.""""""""  What is happening today is that a lot of young, skilled people are not going into education.  The tests show that a disproportionate number are testing at the lowest levels of skills and aptitudes.  That doesn't mean a lot of them won't become good teachers.  We ought to have a society in which both in terms of the environment of teaching being honored as a profession and the pay, is such that the very best, the top of each class, goes into education.  I think last year--as I recall, in Los Angeles--I believe I was told that a beginning teacher there made $13,000 and a beginning policeman $28,000.  I don't begrudge the policeman's salary at all.  But we're saying something about teaching when we give it this low status, and, of course, our kids will pay and our nation will pay.  By now we should know that it is the product of the trained mind that is the greatest source of wealth in America.  It's more important than all of our national resources, everything.  That's from an economic standpoint.  But education, of course--that's why I use the word learning--goes to the basis of our democracy, to our personal enrichment and fulfillment, of our understanding of this ever more dangerous world in which we live.  Education does everything that we need.  And it all begins with what goes on in that classroom.  If it's not effective, if we don't have the best teaching, it's not going to work.  As president, I intend to put a tremendous amount of attention on this.  I've spent a lot of my life in it.

That was a fact of life beginning in the mid-seventies. There was a general consensus among Republicans and Democrats alike, from Richard Nixon to Jimmy Carter, that something had to be done about it, that the national government had to respond to it, that there were differences in kinds of response, but most people acknowledged even then that the path that had been taken in the past would not be enough to steer America into a global economy.",0,3010_1,3010_1

My policies will strengthen the most important institution in our nation, and I am talking about the American family.

Enough Americans to fill Detroit's Cobo Hall four times over were brutalized by assault, rape, or murder while that bill languished on Capitol Hill.

What really got to me was the charge that I didn't care about the numbers of body bags that were coming back from the sands of Kuwait. The vote in the Congress was not overwhelming.

All these polls that are all over the field that these people live and die by, we don't have to read those anymore. But when you enter that voting booth, you have to ask yourself three commonsense questions: Who has the right vision? And I've touched on the positive answers of that today. Who has the right vision for our economic future? Who can lead us through what is a global transition? Which candidate has the character?

Third, how about this one, give us a balanced-budget amendment and make that Congress live within its means. Give us a taxpayer check-off so everybody here that pays taxes, if he wants to or if she decides to, can check off on that tax return 10 percent of the tax, to be used for one thing only: reducing the federal deficit. And Congress must find the spending cuts to go with it. Then give me what forty-three governors have--every day I get legislation down there, every day legislation comes down loaded up with pork--give me the line-item veto.

One thing we're going to do is provide--like it's working in Milwaukee--provide school choice so the parent can decide private, public, or religious schools. We've done well.

I agree with that. Now what does that mean? That means--you just figure it out for yourselves--that means 2 percent on your car payment, your credit card payment, your home payment. Even more important for the overall health of the economy, it means two percent on those loans that business people need to take out to start those new businesses or to expand the businesses.

And we did it without gutting Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, and our commitment to the proposition that everybody in this country is entitled to be treated fairly and justly.",1,3210_14,3210_14
"I also want you to help me in this election period to remind America that for all of our 10.5 million new jobs, there are still people in places that have been left behind. I want you to remind America that you can't require people on welfare to go to work unless they have work. I want you to help me to spark a vast new round of investments in our isolated inner-city areas which have been left behind, help me give the mayors and the others the power to create those jobs and create those opportunities by cleaning up the environment, creating investment incentives, and putting people to work. We cannot ever forget that there are still too many Americans who could no more come to this dinner than a man in the Moon because they're still looking for a job and they need one tomorrow and we need to do our best to make sure that they have their part of twenty-first century America as well.",0,3210_25,3210_25
"Will you help me build that bridge to the twenty-first century? And I want to build a bridge to the twenty-first century that says to every person in America of any age who needs to do it, we will make a college education available to you. Our plan is pretty simple. First of all, we say do no harm. Continue to resist the efforts of the other party to make it harder to get student loans and to raise the cost of the student loans. We want to keep the direct loan program. I pledged to you four years ago when I came here, if you voted for me I would pass a student loan program that would reduce the cost of student loans and let people pay it back as a percentage of their income, so no matter how much they had to borrow they would always be able to afford to go to college. We kept that commitment, and I want to keep it going.",0,3211_27,3211_27
"I don't know how we could arrange it with the school's schedule, but I'd like to take the band and the cheerleaders with me for the rest of the campaign. Sort of rev up the crowd. Superintendent Murray, Dr. Moriarty, Board of Education President Blackstone, to the other distinguished school officials and teachers who are here. Let me say when I got off the airplane today at the International Guard Terminal in Chicago, I was met by the Colonel there, who said, it's a really wonderful school that you're going to visit. And he said, I want you to have this flag pin and these bubble gum cards that those kids made for children in Bosnia. I want you to know what kind of a special place H-F is. So you've got a lot of fans out there that you don't even know about, and I wanted to thank you for doing that. I'm honored to be here.",0,3212_0,3212_0
"Folks, I look at this community, I look at this school, I remember everything I've read about it. I saw that Air Force Colonel bragging on you. I know you sent student volunteers to work in the White House.

"We passed the Violence Against Women Act to try to help deal especially with problems of domestic violence. All over the country police departments like the one here in Cincinnati are training people to be sensitive to that. I met a young officer in the Nashville police department who grew up in a family with five children where they had a lot of problems. And he's devoting his entire life to helping police departments all over America deal with this problem as well as his own. And after one year of focusing on this problem, they cut the death rate in Nashville in half--in one year.",0,3213_28,2012-09-22-milwaukee-wisconsin-0_7
"These things did not happen by accident. These things happened because we had a different philosophy of how the White House and Washington should work. I had never worked in Washington, except as a college student, until I became president. And I didn't like what I saw. There were too many people spending their time asking, who can I blame for this problem; and too few people spending their time asking, what are we going to do about this problem. So we asked that question: What are we going to do? And then we proceeded to do it.",0,3213_8,3213_8

"The second thing we have to do, folks, is keep this economy growing strong. I want to have the right kind of tax cut--one that is targeted to education, to child-rearing, to health care costs, to buying the first-time home--we're not imposing taxes on people if they sell their home for a gain. But I want these things paid for because we still have to balance the budget without bankrupting Medicare, Medicaid, or turning our backs on education and the environment. We have to invest in our future and honor our obligations to the people that share this country with us. And I want you to help me build that kind of bridge to the twenty-first century. I hope you will do that.",0,3216_11,3216_11

Congratulations, Axel.",0,3218_3,3218_3
"So I come here to Tacoma to ask you to help me build a bridge to the twenty-first century. A bridge that focuses first and foremost on making sure that every American has the chance to make the most of his or her own life, and that means world-class education. A bridge to the twenty-first century where, as the Vice President said, we hook up every classroom and every library and every school in the United States to the Information Superhighway, to the Internet, to the World Wide Web, that we give all of our children, for the first time in history, whether they're in the poorest urban districts, the most remote mountain districts--every single child at the first time in history will have access to the same information in the same time at the same quality as the children in the richest schools of America. We have never done it before, we can do it now. Will you help us build that bridge to the twenty-first century?",0,3220_9,3220_9
"Number two, saying we're going to make a community college education, at least two years of education after high school, just as common and universal in four years as a high school diploma is today. We need that to start the new century. And here's how we're going to do it. We're going to say to Americans, if you want to go to community college for two years, all you have to do is work hard, make your grades. You can take off your taxes, dollar for dollar, the tuition cost at the typical community college in the United States.",0,3222_13,3222_13
"I want to thank Tipper Gore and the First Lady, too, for some things they've already talked about. You know, we've worked very hard to improve the health care of the American people. That's a big part of moving into the twenty-first century, to immunize more children, to increase medical research, to speed the movement of drugs to market. In only four years, we've more than doubled the life expectancy of people with HIV--in only four years we've more than doubled the life expectancy of people with HIV and AIDS in just four years, as an example.",0,3222_2,3222_2
"I repeatedly urged Congress to take these steps, and now I urge them to finish their work as quickly as possible. When I have the bill to guarantee forty-eight hours in the hospital for new mothers and their babies, and to stop insurance discrimination against the mentally ill, I will sign it with enthusiasm. Of course, we still have more to do. No child should ever be put at risk in America because a parent has lost his or her job, and the health care that goes with it. We must make sure that people continue to have health care coverage when they're between jobs and looking for a new job. My balanced budget includes these reforms, along with expanded coverage under Medicare for mammograms and respite care for families who have Alzheimer's victims.",0,3223_5,3223_5
"I want to build a bridge to the twenty-first century that will keep this economy growing until everybody has a chance to live up to the fullest of their abilities. That means a lot of things. It means, yes, we have to go on and balance the budget because that will keep interest rates down and that will help you to grow, those of you in the private sector to grow this country. But it means we have to do it in a way that honors our obligations to our parents and our children; to those who through no fault of their own need our help and will do better, and so will we, if they get a little of our help. We have to honor our obligations to the environment and to our future. We have to invest in education and in research and technology.",0,3225_21,3225_21
"We should not, in my view, endanger the national commitment we made thirty years ago to provide health care not only to poor, but largely to middle class families through the Medicaid program--helping seniors into nursing homes, helping poor pregnant women and poor little children and, among the most important things, helping families who have family members with disabilities to keep working and care for their family member with disabilities so that they could go together and maintain a middle class lifestyle. I believe that would me a mistake, and it's not necessary to balance the budget. I also don't think we should sacrifice our future. We shouldn't cut our investments in education, in environmental protection, in research and technology. We need more investments in research and technology. But we can balance the budget and still continue to invest an appropriate amount there.",0,3226_21,3226_21
"Last year, a Republican economist put out a paper I agree with--I agree with. Just last year they said if we did not have a plan to move toward a balanced budget that was credible in the financial markets it would add two percent to the interest rates of every American family and every American business. That's what they said; not me. So you can go home and figure it out. How would it affect you if your credit card payment, your home mortgage payment, your car payment went up 2 percent? Even worse, how would it affect this area after we have worked so hard to finally come out of the devastation of the collapse of the old economy here and to build a new economy if all business loans were 2 percent more expensive?",0,3226_27,1896_37
"And when people need it, they're smart enough to figure out what they need, I believe; that's the reason these institutions are open.

In the area of research and development we just agreed, as many of you have heard me say, we just agreed with IBM to build a joint supercomputer that will do more calculations in a second than you can do on your calculator at home, your hand-held calculator, in 30,000 years.

"And I appreciate what Bob Kerrey said. But to be fair to him, given the prevailing political rhetoric in 1993, it wasn't very easy for a senator from Nebraska to cast the vote he did. But we got the interest rates down. We got the economy going again. We have 10.5 million jobs to show for it, record numbers of new small businesses, the lowest combined rates of home mortgages and inflation and unemployment in 27 years.

I want to build a bridge to the next century where every American family has a chance to benefit from the growing economy, a chance to succeed at home with their children, and to succeed at work. We should expand the Family and Medical Leave Act to give parents a little time off to take their children to the doctor and to parent-teacher conferences. We ought to make the first two years--we ought to make the first two years of college as universal as high school is today by giving families tax cuts to pay for college tuition.

That's what that Brady Bill's all about. That's what that assault weapons ban's all about. He wants to take your gun away. He's going to interfere with your Second Amendment rights.

We can change it forever and for good, and we'll have every American in the mainstream, working, raising their children, being part of one society, not having some isolated forever and trapped in poverty if you will help us and we decide to do it together in every community of America.

I was in Houston the other day, which is hardly a bastion of strength for the Democratic party, and the mayor there, who is a very talented mayor, explicitly, forthrightly and aggressively defended the city's affirmative action policy and still won support for reelection from over 80 percent of the people in his city.

Now, in a way, I sympathize with his plight; for some time I have been wondering when he was going to find something to say that would not offend one of the Republican parties.

"In Illinois, we cleaned up, we disinfected, we fumigated a state government that had been the victim of eight years of magnificent rascality--and I mean Republican rascality. Now, actually it doesn't make any difference whether it is Republican or Democratic rascality; a bad public servant is a bad apple and you throw out a bad apple whatever its variety. That is what I believe and I think that is what we are going to do at every level of our government, if the people are conscious enough of what their responsibility is. But rascals in government are only the uglier practices of wasters in government. Economy is just as important as honesty--for a taxpayer's dollar that is wasted is just as bad as a taxpayer's dollar that is stolen. And here again I lay what I hope is not an immodest claim to some hard and educational experience in making both ends of a government budget meet, in keeping a government lean and trimmed down to an efficient size. I have some idea about that; as the product of practical experience in Illinois, I have learned that economy in government isn't just something that you say you are going to have. You have to grind at it all of the time. You have to grind--everybody--up and down the ladder; the purchasing officers who spend millions of the taxpayers' money, the fellows who deal around in government orders, even the girls who want to use a fresh carbon every time they want to write a letter.

It's like a husband coming into the kitchen, seeing one potato peeling that is too thick, and exploding that now he knows why you can't make ends meet.

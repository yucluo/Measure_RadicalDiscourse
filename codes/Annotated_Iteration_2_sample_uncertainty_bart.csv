The label has changed, but not the stuff in the package. Much as many Americans hope otherwise, official Republicanism remains a policy of indifference to much except the aspirations of property. It remains the spokesman of big business and wealth. Nor should we complain. That is a wholly legitimate function. But it is not the proper function of government, of the executive branch, in this beloved country of ours.America needs today, and needs badly, the restoration of government, which recognizes the existence of people--which will seek to meet their needs, to guarantee their rights, and to enlarge their opportunities. It is the nature and tradition of the Democratic party and of the Liberal tradition to care about people--and care about them, not as statistics in a market survey, but as individual men and women and children.

I believe also in the United States of America, in the promise that it contains and has contained throughout our history of producing a society so abundant and creative and so free and responsible that it can not only fulfill the aspirations of its citizens, but serve equally well as a beacon for all mankind. I do not believe in a super-state. I see no magic to tax dollars which are sent to Washington and then returned. I abhor the waste and incompetence of large-scale federal bureaucracies in this administration, as well as in others. I do not favor state compulsion when voluntary individual effort can do the job and do it well.

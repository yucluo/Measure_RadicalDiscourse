I still believe that to have been a fact, and that is too big a price to pay when people are dying in Vietnam and the condition of our own society is in rapid decline. It is not simply a question of the political career of George McGovern or Senator Eagleton or any other one man--the question is, could we have permitted a situation to develop where the real issues before the country would have been sidetracked over a debate over the health history of one man?

Some are worried about the deterioration of our cities, the mounting crime and drugs, the deterioration of our environment, and much of that can be attributed to the $150 billion we have thrown away in Southeast Asia that we should have used reconstructing and redeeming our own country. But there is one thing I do believe that the American people have in common. I think they want very much to love this country.

But in any event let us assume that this doesn't happen. Let us assume that these inflationary pressures continue. I want an evenhanded policy that doesn't make labor the goat of these wage-price controls. It is just a fact of life today that the wage-price controls are working pretty well in regulating the wages of working people. They are not working in controlling prices. Prices have gone up another eighteen points during the time that Mr. Nixon has been in the White House. The price of everything we buy continues to rise, and if we are going to continue to have wage-price controls I would at least make you a commitment that they would be administered in an evenhanded way, so that we don't have a five and a half percent lid on the income of working people and then permit the salaries and the profits of corporate executives to skyrocket in some cases as much as 100 percent.

"CARTER. I don't know if any of you saw my wife on Meet the Press yesterday. Did anybody see it? I thought she did a superb job, and I don't think I'm prejudiced on that point, but as she pointed out I would never increase taxes on Americans who work for a living, or who report all their tax, all their income on a tax form. We have unbelievable loopholes in the tax laws that make the tax laws disgraceful, that favor those who have very high incomes. Those loopholes only are applicable, in almost every instance, to those who have incomes of $50,000 or more, who have a very large estate and can generate tremendous amounts of income. Last year, 1974 tax returns, there were 3,200 people who made over $50,000 a year and paid not a nickel of income tax. There were over 800 that made over $100,000, and 244 who made over $200,000 income that year and didn't pay a nickel in income tax. And when they don't pay their taxes, you know who pays it for them. You and the other working people of America who don't have lobbyists constantly in Washington trying to carve out a special privilege for their own constituents. As I said in the debate the other night, you can't have a lobbyist with the proceeds from an unemployment check. And so we do need comprehensive tax reform. But I want to repeat again, I will never raise taxes on someone who gets their income from working or who reports all their income on an income tax return.",2379,dem,1976,FALSE

"I have people ask me, from time to time, if I don't get discouraged about the public opinion polls and about the obvious advantage that the Republicans have over us in this election. And the answer is of course, anybody has moments when he is discouraged in an uphill fight of this kind. And I know it is uphill. I know we are short on money. I know we have made some mistakes. But I want everyone here to know that I have been in politics almost twenty years and there was never one moment, in all that twenty years, when I didn't have to fight uphill for every victory that I have ever scored. So whenever I get a little bit discouraged, I think of those young men of ours out in Vietnam who have sat in their cells in Hanoi for six or seven years. And I think about that little Vietnamese girl that I saw burning with napalm running right into the camera lens. And that picture ought to be on the conscience of every man and woman and every boy and girl in this land. So when I think of that, we don't have time to be discouraged. We don't have time to look back and we don't have time for four more years of that kind of senseless destruction and death. I think of men and women who are without jobs and I see it on the faces of people in all parts of this country who want to work--some are trained engineers and scientists and they can't get work. Then I think--we can't stand four more years of that kind of unemployment in this country. I think of young children right here in Illinois suffering from hunger, and young GI's coming back from Vietnam, some of them hopelessly hooked on heroin, and I think of young mothers who can't pay their grocery bills. And we can't stand four more years of that. I think of the wiretappers and the war mongers and discrimination. And I know we can't take four more years of that. I think of millions of these older people living out their lives in loneliness, many of them at the poverty level or below; the education bill; the child development bill and some of the health bills. And I know we can't take four more years of that. I don't think we can take four more years of the harassment by this administration of the free press in this country. I do not think that we can take four more years of the leadership that has no real vision of the greatness of America, because it is still true that where there is no vision that people perish. And I have been with the people of this country and I say to you--let us not be discouraged tonight. Like Franklin Roosevelt, I love a good fight. My spirit is high and in the words of the song--let us think about the great unfinished business of this country and let us grow on the great historic, spiritual, moral and sources of the strength of this nation and remember that old hymn of the faith that goes back to the days of the black slaves when they sang, ""Sometimes I feel like a motherless chile.""BUSINESS, CORPORATECAMPAIGN FINANCE--CORRUPTION/ETHICSCOST OF LIVINGDEBATES, PRESIDENTIALHISTORY--UNITED STATES--PRESIDENTSSPECIAL INTEREST GROUPSVIETNAM WARWAGES/HOUSEHOLD INCOMEWATERGATE",2219,dem,1972,FALSE

In the face of this accumulated record it is fair to ask how much of the $10 million secret fund came from those who received special favors in the past. How much is in anticipation of special favors in the future? What is it all going to cost the people in higher prices and higher taxes? In sum, is the presidency being bought in 1972?

Governor Carter, referring to international affairs, do you feel it is necessary for us to continue our current situation with South Africa in order to be effective in bringing about majority rule in that area and would you foresee any circumstance in the government under your leadership to provide military assistance to guard the principles which they are fighting for? CARTER. My commitment to the American people is that I will never again get militarily involved in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security is directly threatened. I would doubt that would require military involvement in South Africa. There are a lot of things that we can do that we are not now doing. One is the use of public forums--the United Nations, the Organization of African States, the public commitments of the president himself, the Secretary of State--influence that can be exerted on the minority governments through business interests that obviously have a great influence there. The arousal of public opinion in all its forms, the universal insistence on human rights and economic sanctions, if necessary to expedite the purposes that we have espoused, and the full support for United Nations decisions of which we in the past have been a part but which we have not enforced. So I would hope that we could achieve early majority rule in all the nations of Africa using those means that I have described to you without the use of military force.

"And now, if I could conclude with one very personal note, that would only be appropriate in this city. My father, as you know, was born on a little farm in Ohio, in Vinton County. And he came to this city of Columbus as a teenager and later in his early twenties and he was a motorman on the old streetcar line that they used to have in Columbus. They are gone now. And after he was on the streetcar for a few years, he went to California where he met my mother who was born in Indiana. They were married, and when they were there they raised a family, five boys. There was a lot of sickness in that family, two boys died with tuberculosis. My father also and my mother in their late years were ill. But I remember my father's attitude about America. I think it's yours, and it's certainly mine. He was not a rich man, he was not a man that somebody would call a big man, but he was a very proud man, proud of this country, proud of his Ohio roots, proud of the dignity which he had earned. And my father always used to talk not about his difficult past, because his mother died when he was in the sixth grade, and he had to quit school and go to work, but he always used to tell us, the boys, that in America what we all lived for was to develop in this country a better life for our children than we had for ourselves. That's the American dream. That is what my public life has been dedicated to. And I tell you today, as I stand here in Columbus, here breathing the same air that my father so many years ago was able to breathe, I realize the heritage that I have, I am proud of it, I hope I'm worthy of it, and I pledge to you that the new generation, if I can have this opportunity to serve, I trust, will not have to fight three wars as did my generation; that the new generation will not have to go through a period of rising crime, as has mine; that the new generation will have opportunities such as mine never dreamed of. It can happen. I need your help to make it happen.

Now, if you had asked them ten years ago, every one of them would have said the United States. But in 1970, a majority of the people of those countries thought that the Russians would be first, both militarily and scientifically. That is what hurts the United States. If they think we are on the decline and the Russians are on the rise, if they think that our brightest day is somewhere in the past and now the future belongs to the Soviets, then all those people who want to go with the winner turn against us and move in the direction of Moscow and Peking. I want it said in 1970 that we are first, scientifically and militarily, educationally, economically. We should be first because we represent the greatest system of government ever devised.

So we will end the war, and end it fast, and bring our troops and our prisoners home, and then we will get on with the real business of this country. At the top of the list is to provide a decent job for every man and woman in this country who is able to work. And then we will address those loopholes in our tax laws that provide a burden on the backs of the middle and low income people of this country. We will recover some $22 billion now going through the loopholes and this is the money that we will use to support our schools and to relieve and reduce the burden of property taxes across this country.

"NARRATOR. The Vice President of the United States. VICE PRESIDENT BUSH. Tonight brings to a close a long campaign, and as the shouting subsides, I want you to think for a minute about the choice you will make when you pull that curtain closed tomorrow in the voting booth, because the choice before you is very important. We've made historic strides in these last eight years. We took a country that had lost its confidence and put her back on her feet. And now, with our defenses restored, we've been able to negotiate an historic agreement with the Soviet Union, one that will eliminate, for the first time in our lifetimes, an entire generation of nuclear weapons. Tonight, America and indeed the world is at peace. We took an economy that had gone sour and gave it strength. Eight years ago, inflation was roaring along at 13 percent, interest rates were out of control at 21 percent, millions of Americans couldn't find work. And tonight, the inflation rate has been cut to 4 percent, interest rates are half what they were and Americans are working again. More of our workforce is taking home a paycheck than in any time in our history. And tonight, we've tried to give you some idea of how I as president would build on the solid foundation we've laid. I'll keep creating jobs for every American in the cities, in rural America, for young people and old, and yes, for our disabled citizens as well. I'll keep America strong with the hard-eyed realism that has kept American power second to none. I will keep our streets safe from crime, our environment safe from the ravages of reckless pollution, and our schools safe from drugs. Most of all, I will keep America proud, because I do believe that we are, as Lincoln said, the last great hope of man on earth. I respect my opponent. I admire his devotion to family. And I appreciate his decision to enter public service--what Teddy Roosevelt once called ""the arena."" But I do believe we are guided by fundamentally different philosophies, a great divide, an honest difference of opinion on which approach will lead America into the '90s, stronger and more secure than ever. I believe that the low tax and high opportunity policies we have pursued for the last eight years are working. Americans are better off than they were eight years ago. And if you elect me president, you will be better off four years from now than you are today. I believe in a concept called ""Peace through strength."" The national security of the United States is the first responsibility of the president and I firmly believe that American strength and American resolve have helped bring about the peace we now enjoy. My opponent has no experience in national security affairs. I don't believe we can take a risk on an issue as important as our national security. America tonight is a strong nation. Our economy is creating jobs, our defenses are solid and our spirit is restored. And what I ask you to think about is ""What brought us to this point?"" Should we move forward as I pledged to do? Or should we risk retreat? What it all comes down to is which set of values will keep America's future bright and who you trust to stick to those values. I cannot predict all of the challenges America will face in the years ahead. I can tell you what principles will guide me, what values I hold dear, and I can say that I believe I have the experience to be a steady hand guiding our country. Over a hundred years ago, just prior to an election, Lincoln wrote to a friend, and here is what he said. ""I know there's a God and I know he hates injustice. I see the storm coming and I know his hand is in it. But he has a place and a part for me, I believe that I'm ready."" My fellow Americans, I ask for your support, I ask for your vote.

We, in other words, fit in with the basic movement of our time. The Communists do not. Therefore, while there are a great many clouds on the horizon, and there are a great many uncertainties about Africa, Latin America, and Asia, and Eastern Europe, I think that we represent the way to the future.

"During the war, you remember, when we all knew America was in danger, we only wanted the best, the most unselfish. We had no time for building political mantraps or for inventing derogatory tales. It was a heart-lifting moment. But a cold war leads the timid and the discontented into frustration. And out of frustration comes pettiness--the niggling, pitiful picture of a confused, divided country which these office-seekers are now painting. And this, of course, was the very purpose for which the Russians invented the cold war and imposed it upon us. They hoped we would feel frustrated, shackled by circumstance. They hoped we would fall to quarreling among ourselves and thus betray our mission. But the American giant will not be shackled! We shall not be tempted by the cold war to be half-regretful, half-ashamed of our strength--or frightened of it, which is worse. Regretful--God help us--in the face of the stirring truth that Lincoln's vision has come true, that now we are indeed the ""last, best hope of earth""--so recognized by all the free world, which implores us to be great, to lead with magnanimity and, above all, with patience. The very powerful, if they are good, must always be patient. And still some of us regret it! Some of us say: ""Why can't life leave us alone? We don't want to lead. We want to be undisturbed."" What would our fathers have said to such talk? From the dawn of our revolution they saw America as the savior--not merely in terms of power, but in terms of goodness. They knew that Providence had given us this empty, unexploited continent for a purpose. And they knew that it must be a purpose which includes all men--for the same God made us all. In 1787 George Washington said: ""The preservation of the sacred fire of liberty, and the destiny of the Republican form of government, are justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finally staked, on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people."" At that time we had less than four million inhabitants. But there was no doubt, no fear, in Washington's mind regarding our destiny. In 1858 Abraham Lincoln said: ""Our reliance is in the love of liberty which God has planted in us. Our defense is in the spirit which prized liberty as the heritage of all men, in all lands everywhere."" At that time there were about thirty million Americans. And we were threatened with civil war. But there was no doubt, no fear, in Lincoln's mind. He saw the war and the dissolution of the Union as a threat to the new, revolutionary idea of the free man and to democratic aspirations everywhere. In 1915 Woodrow Wilson said: ""The interesting and inspiring thought about America is that she asks nothing for herself except what she has a right to ask for humanity itself."" By that time we were a world power, about to enter into a world war. But there was no doubt, no fear, in Woodrow Wilson's mind. He knew, as in truth we have always known, that we were destined to be an example and to assume the burden of greatness. So we are marked men, we Americans at the mid-century point. We have been tapped by fate--for which we should forever give thanks, not laments. What a day to live in! What a flowering of the work and the faith of our fathers! Who in heaven's name would want America less strong, less responsible for the future? And precisely because we are trapped by fate, we must be wise and patient as well as strong. This means that we must live, intensely live, the faith which has made us free and thereby invincible. ""Despotism may govern without faith, but liberty cannot."" American power is not just coal and iron and oil; cotton and wheat and corn. It is not just our forests and our mountain ranges, and the huge meandering rivers of our central plains, and the high dry cattle country, and this lucky land of yours between the mountains and the sea. It is not even all these things plus a hundred and sixty million people. It is these things, plus the people, plus the idea! So a second temptation of the cold frustrating war--which we also proudly reject--is to become so distracted by our troubles that we take this faith too much for granted, that we salute it--as some of us salute our religion--and then go our own way unchanged. If we do not make it part of us--keep it forever before us, intense and demanding and clear--the faith might die and we should then die with it. What is this ""American idea"" which we so justly venerate? I suggest that the heart of it is the simple but challenging statement that no government may interfere with our conscience, may tell us what to think. All our freedoms, all our dynamic unleashed energies, stem from this. We Americans just naturally talk like this: ""No government can tell me what to think. No government can tell me what to do, unless it can prove that the common good is served by such interference."" This is the American way of living. Yet the same Republicans--the dinosaur wing of that party--who object to service from our government--who call everything ""creeping socialism,"" who talk darkly of ""dictatorship""--these same men begin to hint that we are ""subversive,"" or at best the tools of our country's enemies, when we boast of the great strides toward social justice and security we have already made, and of the still greater strides we plan. They laugh at us, superciliously, when we say we are the political party with a heart. To honor and uphold our faith, therefore, we must never let them confuse us about the difference between what government should do, if possible, and what it must never do if America is to survive. It should strengthen us in our freedom by fostering widespread ownership and as much economic independence as possible. In the towns and counties, in the state capitals and in Washington, that great work goes forward today. But never must government step across the line which separates the promotion of justice and prosperity from the interference with thought, with conscience, with the sacred private life of the mind. If you like, this is the distinction between the things that are God's and the things that are Caesar's. The mind is the expression of the soul, which belongs to God and must be let alone by government. But farm prices, minimum wages, old-age pensions, the regulation of monopoly, the physical safety of society--these things are Caesar's province, wherein the government should do all that is humanly possible. But those among us who would bar us from attempting our economic and social duty are quick with accusations, with defamatory hints and whispering campaigns, when they see a chance to scare or silence those with whom they disagree. Rudely, carelessly they invade the field of conscience, of thought,--the field which belongs to God and not to senators--and not to protect the republic, but to discredit the individual. Let us remember also that the first of the seven deadly sins is spiritual pride: the sin which assures me that I know and you don't, so that I give myself permission to use any dubious or dishonest means to discredit your opinion. Because we have always thought of government as friendly, not as brutal, character assassins and slanderers in the Congress of the United States have a free hand in the methods they use. We never foresaw that the cult of thought control and of the big lie would come to America. So if their conscience permits, they can say almost anything. And if my opponent's conscience permits, he can try to help all of them get re-elected. But will he have strengthened or weakened the American idea? This is no small thing, this remorseless attack upon freedom of conscience, freedom of thought. A few peddlers of hate and fear would be of little consequence if they had not been welcomed as satellites by Senator Taft and included in the leadership of this strange crusade. And none of them would be significant if the General--who was implored to come home by Republican leaders so that they might be quit of Senator Taft--had not yielded to the demands of his beaten foe. But because of that surrender, because of those strange allies in his queer crusade, our role in world history, our faithfulness to the men who made the United States is challenged in this election. Finally, then, let us recall that our basic faith in liberty of conscience has an ancient ancestry. We can trace it back through Christian Europe, and through pagan Rome, back to the Old Testament prophets. It is by no means exclusive with us. It is in fact our bond of unity with all free men. But we are its ordained guardians today. Let us lift up our hearts, therefore--glad of our strength, proud of the task it imposes. So far from being half-defeated, half-divided, half-bankrupt--while we are true to ourselves, we can never be defeated; while we accept the honorable burden of leadership, we can never be divided. And in the name of that burden we shall find the means and the determination to spend in money and in labor and in hard thought whatever is needed to save ourselves and our world.",979,dem,1952,FALSE

I mentioned last night on TV two villages in Brazil where the health standards were so bad that not one baby lived beyond the first year.  And the Communists are working in those areas night and day, and so is Castro.  Which side will they choose?  The United States, which has been indifferent to their problem?  Or will they decide to move to the Communists who raise a banner and identify themselves with them?  We are going to have to do much better, and I believe, with a new Democratic administration, committed to progress, committed to justice for our people, committed to the development of their talents, regardless of their race or their creed or their color, we can demonstrate that we are a strong and vital and progressive society.

If Mr. Nixon honestly believes that, then in my judgment he has completely misread the trend of the times.  If he does not believe it and runs on those slogans merely as a device for winning this election, then he makes the same mistake that Stanley Baldwin made in 1935 in England, which cost the British so heavily and almost resulted in the enslavement of Europe.  I believe that on this occasion this year, in this election the Democratic party is on the side of right, because our basic feeling is that unless this country is prepared to move again in the 1960s, we will not lose only our position as the leaders of the free world, but we will also endanger our security.

On October 9, 1968, when Mr. Nixon was asking for the votes of the American people, he said those who cannot restore peace in four years do not deserve another chance, and I say ""Amen"" to that. There is not one thing that we can accomplish in a way of a settlement of this war in 1972 that we couldn't have accomplished just as well four years ago when Mr. Nixon first came into office. And this is why my heart goes out to every family in this land who has lost a precious soldier in this senseless war which should have been ended when Mr. Nixon first came into office on a pledge to end it. As we meet here this afternoon we are still spending $250 million a week killing people and destroying the countryside and the villages of Southeast Asia. I say the time has come, without one more day of delay, for us to stop this waste, to stop this killing and then begin investing that $250 million a week in building up our cities, strengthening our housing, strengthening our transportation and doing those things that will put this country back on the path of peace and justice for all of our people.",2270,dem,1972,FALSE

Mr. Gallup, and I don't always agree with his polls, did take a poll in February of this year. In ten countries scattered around the world, he asked them the single question, ""Do you believe by 1970 the United States or the Soviet Union will be first, militarily and scientifically?"" In every one of those countries a majority of the people thought that the Soviet Union would be first. Why? A country of one-half of our productive power, the most backward country of Europe thirty years ago, and yet the majority of the people around the world think that they will pass us in both of those areas in the next ten years.

And the issue you have to face is who do you trust to protect our workers, our communities, and our environment.  George Bush, whose administration encourages American corporations to move to other countries with low wages and lax environmental laws and even spend your tax money to finance it?  Or Bill Clinton and Al Gore, who have a long record of fighting for good jobs and a healthy environment?  Do you trust George Bush, who's amassed the worst economic record in 50 years, the first decline in manufacturing, two-thirds of the working people with their wages going down, one in ten Americans on food stamps, quadrupled the debt in the last 12 years with our investment in the future going down and no strategy for the future?

We have to build a new economy in which incomes and employment are rising and companies are growing, a society in which opportunity is expanding and hope comes alive again.  So I say to you, my fellow Americans, we have to have the courage to change.  And a part of that change should encourage, should involve a closer relationship with Mexico, now under better leadership than ever in my lifetime.

I forded the rivers in the flood and on the snow and on the ice 10,000 miles. I have lain upon hard ground on the prairie with nothing but a canopy of heaven above us.

I want to say to you that one of the happiest experiences that I have had in my brief life as a politician has been today in New York state. Not the least of it has been the fact that I have been privileged to travel with one of the most beloved and respected citizens of our generation, your Senator Herbert Lehman of New York."

Are these the men we want to lead our nation in the struggle against Communism today? All the while they proclaim ferocious anti-Communism. Indeed, the best way they can apparently find to obscure their retreat from the fight against Communism abroad, the fight to keep it distant from our shores, is by shouting and screaming every hour on the hour about how much they hate Communism at home."

In all events, I am very grateful to all of you for being here this afternoon. I have just had a most interesting experience. I was presented on the rear platform of the train with an enormous placard--here it is--they are all of the Ike buttons, gathered by the Volunteers for Stevenson from people who have switched."

Each needs a special sort of ministry. Let us remember that, while Christ preached the doctrine of eternal salvation, he also did the work that needed to be done in the kingdom of man. He healed the sick, fed the poor, sustained the weak, and sheltered all those who were in want. So must we, I think, as Americans continue prudently to extend to the needy of this earth that material help which we almost alone can give. And we ought to do this not grudgingly, but with a clear recognition that it is far better to give than to receive. In a word, the first answer to Communism is not a lesser, but a fuller application of Judaic- Christian ethics to the neighborhood of nations around us."
6.73360342077787e-05,0.999932663965792,1067_11,0,"I don't believe that these changes in the nature of business have been adequately recognized by everyone in government. I think we must sweep out of the corridors of government, at all levels, national and state, those lingering suspicions which are a holdover from an earlier and very different time.  This is a problem which concerns me very deeply, for I am convinced that both government and business must learn to live together in harmony, before an era of bad temper turns into something infinitely worse. We must avoid at all costs the bitter struggle of class against class, which results inevitably in a drift either to the extreme left or to the extreme right. And you and I know that either kind of drift would end up at the same dreadful destination: a police state with all of the horrors that we have seen in Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia. "
7.91495146885739e-05,0.999920850485311,1068_1,0,"I am most grateful to all of you for coming out here at this inconvenient hour and I appreciate your courtesy, and I am sure that your presence here is a good omen both for the Democratic party and for our country. When so many people get up so early in the morning to hear about the great issues on which we will make a decision next Tuesday, we can all feel confident that the future of America rests in responsible hands. It is a sign that every one of you is taking seriously your duty as a citizen; for, in our country it is the people who make all of the final decisions."
7.41138651355824e-05,0.999925886134864,1069_9,0,"We also have my sister Mrs. Ernest Ives. And now I should like to present to you a famous Pennsylvanian, a beloved and honored lady of this state, Mrs. Emma Guffey Miller. Have we got any more beauties to present?"
0.000100978021846292,0.999899021978153,1085_15,0,"No, I've seen and heard the deep-throated courage and confidence and faith of strong men and women and happy children--people who still believe in one another, in spite of all the timid, doubting men. And I thank them every one for the reception they have given me--for their infinite courtesy and their heartening friendliness.  I have asked you for your support for my candidacy. I ask you now for support of our common faith in this country. The confidence we've inherited is our greatest wealth, the source of our strength. "
6.70727019960352e-05,0.999932927298004,1106_4,0,"There is no other way to account for the reception given to a Republican nominee--and remember this, accompanied as his chief advisor by a Yankee Governor from almost as Yankee a state as you can find, New Hampshire--a reception in Atlanta, followed by Jacksonville, Miami, Tampa, Birmingham and Little Rock. It was always the same and usually, ladies and gentlemen, with the shout along the roadsides and in the crowds, Throw 'em out, Ike; give 'em Hell. That is a battle cry that has now been repeated vociferously, in Philadelphia, even more loudly in Minnesota, yesterday in Cleveland, and I assure you I heard it many times coming in from the airport only a couple of hours ago."
7.09383149310341e-05,0.999929061685069,1108_0,0,"Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen:  If I cannot be heard in the roar I have no objection to your crying louder, but I do not want to put any more strain on these poor old vocal chords, that are unaccustomed to the kind and amount of talking I have been doing lately, than I have to.  It is a very, very great pleasure to be here with you this morning. Once before I visited the Republican National Headquarters, but under different circumstances and certainly in accommodations far less commodious than these."
6.80881484335697e-05,0.999931911851566,1175_1,0,"Now it happens today is September 25th.  It is one of the significant days in our history that is not often celebrated.  It is the day that marked the adoption of the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution.  In that Bill of Rights it specifies what are the rights of human beings as opposed to the power of government, the limits of what government can do to the individual today, and those ten amendments, possibly coupled with the organization our forefathers gave us, is the real genius of American government.  When those rights, any one of them, comes in peril from within or any threat from without, it is time for every loyal American, not just the rich, not just the farmers, not just the workmen, but everybody.  It is time for every loyal American to rise up, take a look, gird himself for battle, and fight off the encroachment."
6.8742581054427e-05,0.999931257418946,1178_30,0,"But informed people know that the plant is being located here because a careful investigation by a great private industry discovered that the waters of the Savannah River were peculiarly suitable for certain processes essential to the development of atomic energy.  Of course, it's possible--though I doubt it--that the Savannah River, itself, has its source in a Washington Bureau. This, my friends, is a good year for some straight political thinking.  It is a bad year to be fooled.  It would be a particularly bad year to be fooled into thinking that the Washington mess is the fault of you, the people.  And we will not be fooled into the belief that this great land of ours and the progress we have achieved here are blessings handed down by government.  We are going to think straight--straight through to the conclusion that America is what free Americans--with courage and sweat and drive--have made it.  "
5.99727387746673e-05,0.999940027261225,1179_4,0,"That record is a distinguished one.  It should be remembered that the negative votes on the North Atlantic Treaty, the Vandenberg Resolution and the Marshall Plan included negative votes of the party in power.  That is a tribute not just to a man but to a party.  Senator Vandenberg, if he were living, would be the first one to resent the suggestion that the votes to which I refer represented a personal triumph.  Rather, they represented to him the dedication of a party which, although it was an opposition party, subordinated partisan considerations to the national welfare."
6.15772744608806e-05,0.999938422725539,1197_11,0,"There are a lot of other parts to this verbal barrage.  For example, the Republicans are accused of attempting to abolish social security.  Sheer bunk!  What the Republicans have said is this:  our purpose is to keep the dollar from going down further so that there will be no further erosion of your savings account, of your bank account, of your insurance policy and of your bonds.  But instead of seeing those things go down the drain of inflation you will keep them, and moreover they have said that where inflation has already overtaken some of these things, these amounts, and they have gone down below decency, that must be corrected, which means corrected upward.  They have also pledged in their platform to expand social security to go to classes not so far covered."
7.13384564672821e-05,0.999928661543533,1207_1,0,"You know, this thing seems to me to be particularly significant:  this evening there will be 6,000 more Americans than there were last evening.  Those Americans, of course, are largely our new babies born.  When each baby is born today it gets a very extraordinary present as it arrives into this world:  it gets its share of the national debt; it owes $1,750 for the privilege of having been born."
8.00531100605699e-05,0.99991994688994,1207_5,0,"First, the government you have must be one to excite your pride, to get you to unite behind it.  There can be no peace in this world until there is a strong America leading us toward peace--strong spiritually, economically, financially, and finally militarily. We are going to have that kind of strength only if we are united behind a government that excites our pride.  Such a government will have great prestige abroad; the free countries will want to join with us in establishing a collective security."
6.55064778655899e-05,0.999934493522134,1226_0,0,"My first and most pleasant duty, of course, is to thank you for coming out here today.  You give me a chance to look in your faces, to bring you a word of greeting, and to give you one or two of the thoughts that are on my mind as we go through this political campaign.  I have had a wonderful day and a half in your state, starting up at Sacramento.  It seems to me I have been covering ground very rapidly and every place there seems to be a new surprise.  Now, for example, here when the so-called professional politicians began to give me my lessons in this new art a few months back, they told me there was one thing you could not do-go to an airport and address a group of American citizens.  I was told they simply wouldn't come.  So I find out today that at least in Long Beach those political friends of mine were wrong, and I am delighted."
8.32798291821656e-05,0.999916720170818,1236_7,0,It is wonderful to visit Houston and see on every hand the signs of your vigorous expansion.  You have fulfilled the vision of those hardy pioneers who set up the early capital of the Texas republic down at the corner of Main Street and Texas Avenue.  You have vindicated their resolute belief in the unlimited future of this region.  Your growth has been phenomenal--the vast industrial development ringing the city; your beautiful churches; your Rice Institute; your University of Houston; your wonderful medical center; and your other institutions of culture and learning.
7.43735203727386e-05,0.999925626479627,1290_14,0,"Now, ladies and gentlemen, in concluding this short statement, I want to say this:  I do not come before you to engage in any competition of political promises.  This party in power in the last seven years has used up every possible political promise there is, and some of them have gotten pretty shopworn.  For example, there is no easier way to duck an issue than to say this, I will promise you a law, well knowing they cannot deliver it.  There is no easier way to get out of a situation.  What I promise you is work, never ending work, to make certain that justice is done.  So I cannot come before you with the competition of promises, but I do come before you with a pledge, and this is the pledge.  If you want to put this crusade at the helm of your government; if you want to substitute for these 22 caliber men who are trying to hold 45 caliber jobs the finest men and women that we can draw from all sections of this country, from every walk of life--and let me say plainly, based upon merit and without respect to color or creed; if you want to have a government of that kind, then you belong in this crusade."
7.51981388233734e-05,0.999924801861177,1293_2,0,"I am exceedingly proud, my friends, to address you in a hall that is a war memorial, dedicated to our veterans. I hear that more than twenty-thousand people contributed their funds to make this hall possible.  Whenever anything comes to my attention that involves veterans, I, like most other old soldiers, want to reminisce a bit.  Never do I get tired of reminiscing about the heroism, the sacrifices, the devotion to our country of the millions of men and women who made up our fighting forces in World War II.  I am really proud that the city of Johnstown has chosen to take a building such as this that will be used by your citizenry through the years to make it a lasting useful memorial to their services."
7.08392808981105e-05,0.999929160719102,1302_2,0,"And now, my friends, when this campaign started, we were promised--a very high-sounding promise, put in very nicely-flowing words--that the United States was going to be given the spectacle of a political contest conducted on such a plane, the opposition said that we would be all educated and elevated.  It was a very, very wonderful promise.  I sincerely appreciated it, but what has happened?  If you are going to educate, you have to start with the record, with the facts.  Who among you here would like the job of defending the record of the government of the past seven years?  Well, I don't have to ask that one again.  Of course, they can't defend that record, a record in which, with all of the assets and resources of this great nation with which we came out of World War II, they have frittered them away--as they have struggled and fumbled and stumbled and fallen in the foreign field.  They have brought us no closer to peace.  We have had these emergencies after emergencies.  We have lost China.  We have lost souls, human souls, to the Communistic dictatorship in the Kremlin at the rate of 100 million per year."
7.28426319012353e-05,0.999927157368099,1303_4,0,"The essential difference between this worn-out bureaucracy in Washington and the crusade is this:  They want to sit in Washington and direct your lives and your businesses and check up on you from thousands or hundreds of miles away.  We want to see you develop yourselves with every single thing you have got in you and hold the government ready to help you whenever it is necessary, but to work with you and not just to work you. We believe that if we bring to Washington the outstanding men and women of this crusade--your representatives, people coming right out of this crowd, men who have been introduced to you from this platform--that all of those people will be your guarantee that there is no crookedness in government, that subversion and Communism isn't getting inside of government.  They will be your guarantee that if a stray individual does go bad and betrays his trust, that kind of thing will be ripped out of government without delay."
7.63268733591851e-05,0.999923673126641,1307_8,0,"I am very proud also that I had wonderful friends who jumped into the breach to defend me against this charge.  I didn't have to do it myself.  Rabbi Silver and Bernie Baruch and Cardinal Spellman took care of that one, and Judge Reynolds and a few others took care of it.  I more than ever pledged myself to see that we remove the remaining stains of discrimination from our national life.  We can do that if it isn't made a partisan issue, but we must have the aid of men from both parties--if they are men of good will and that is what I intend to do--and what I say I will do I will do."
7.50382542210679e-05,0.999924961745779,1317_1,0,"I want also to express my admiration for the fine ticket for state and Congressional offices which our party has selected here in Massachusetts.  My friend Chris Herter has broad experience and a warm concern for people which fit him to be a great governor of your great state. I stand before you, tonight, in the solemn knowledge that--by this hour of the morrow--you may have summoned me to serve as president of the United States."
6.22904883494442e-05,0.999937709511651,1366_2,0,"And if you think that's something I tell all the folks, I might tell you that my fondness for this state got me in first-class trouble two weeks ago in Miami, Florida. I was going full speed ahead when I heard myself saying, and you folks here in California know what I mean. They sure did."
6.44366169880486e-05,0.999935563383011,1381_15,0,"Yet the Republicans sneer and call it nonsense and a theatrical gesture, even though we are now learning that the administration itself had been giving serious consideration to this same or a similar proposal. When I have suggested stronger, more efficient armed forces than the inefficient, expensive, and undemocratic draft system provides, they scream in unison that I'm trying to weaken our armed forces. Yet leaders of our defense services have been saying the same thing for months. And the Democrats in Congress have even forced the Eisenhower Administration to do more for our defenses than it wanted to."
8.52230471884337e-05,0.999914776952811,1402_18,0,"In the meantime, wages have been raised and the cost of living has been extraordinarily stable in the last three years. It is true that you can say technically the cost of living is high. It has gone up 2.5 percent since we have been in, but it went up 45 percent or more in the last seven years of the preceding administration."
7.08171945704525e-05,0.99992918280543,1407_36,0,"Four years ago, my friends, we set out to do a job together. When I think of the America that we would like to see by 1960, I say: let us get on with the rest of the job. Thank you very much."
0.000132406609473851,0.999867593390526,1417_24,0,"Yet in our labor toward the peace we seek, we must comprehend always its basic requirements and face up to them manfully. First: strength--spiritual, intellectual, economic and military strength. Second: unity--our clear awareness that the road to peace is one that all nations must travel together, else neither can do so. Third: faith--a faith in the greatness of our purpose that inspires in all of us a readiness to work and to sacrifice that this greatest of all mankind's hopes may one day be realized."
7.71349630027831e-05,0.999922865036998,1427_3,0,"And may I remark, with your permission, that if I were privileged tonight to speak also in your sister state of Connecticut, as I am privileged to speak here, I would speak of Senator Bush in exactly the same words. Now first of all, I feel great, largely because of the way you have greeted me. But tonight I am reminded, my friends, of the time when last we met here in the Garden four years ago."
8.14270261356916e-05,0.999918572973864,1435_7,0,"I might apply this principle for you to the problem of civil rights. We believe, with the Constitution, in the equality before the law of every single American. In making this a reality in this day and time, we believe in cooperation. We believe that in getting the cooperation that comes about from willing working together of Americans, you achieve much more than you do just by writing a hard and fixed dictum of law and say everybody must conform."
7.28182197174917e-05,0.999927181780282,1486_8,0,"Tonight, we salute George Meany as a symbol of that struggle and as a reminder that the fight to eliminate poverty and human exploitation is a fight that goes on in our own day. But in 1960, the cause of liberalism cannot content itself with carrying on the fight for human justice and economic liberalism here at home. For here and around the world, the fear of war hangs over us every morning and every night. It lies, expressed or silent, in the minds of every American. We cannot banish it by repeating that we are economically first or that we are militarily first, for saying so doesn't make it so. More will be needed than goodwill missions or talking back to Soviet politicians or increasing the tempo of the arms race. More will be needed than good intentions, for we know where that paving leads."
6.23684119384963e-05,0.999937631588061,1513_8,0,"They were the presidents of the United States who led, and I think in the next eight years the United States is going to have to lead again. We cannot be bound by the last eight years. We cannot be committed by a party of the past. We cannot wait for Mr. Khrushchev's words, for the Communists are not satisfied with their gains of the last months, with their lead in missiles and space, and their foothold in Cuba, and half of Indochina, and their new influence in Laos and Africa and Asia. They will keep on driving and expanding and gaining without regard to all the kitchen debates and without regard to what goes on in the United Nations unless we have a president and a country in the 1960s that acts first and acts fast."
8.35296861280333e-05,0.999916470313872,1520_11,0,"Fourth, around the world, when we and the Soviet Union are engaged in a great competition to see whether the world will be free or slave, we continue to persist in regarding the production of food from the ground as a problem, as a surplus, as a burden, when it is a blessing from the Lord. I think we need an administration which so regards it. We spend $42 billion on defense every year. Those ships sail the oceans. They protect us but they do not serve our people and the world. I do not regard the distribution of food around the world as a great burden upon us. I regard it as an opportunity, to use our assets in a way which will attract people to the cause of freedom. I am glad that this is our problem, and not starvation. I am glad we can produce more than we can consume, if we share it usefully, for we are our brother's keeper; and if we have great assets in this country, I believe we should hold out the hand of friendship. When hundreds of millions of people stagger through their lives searching for food and we have it, and we are trying to determine which way the world will go, I would rather see our food used in an imaginative way than to argue in kitchens or anyplace else. I want to help people and I want the United States to be identified with that cause as it was in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and Harry Truman."
6.1605643259937e-05,0.99993839435674,1526_2,0,"The sun is setting and I understand there are no lights--the lights are going out for the Republican party all over the United States. But I want to say one or two things. I spoke this afternoon at the plowing contest on what I consider to be the number one domestic problem which the United States faces, and that is the sharp decline in agricultural income. I think the farmers of North Dakota and the farmers of South Dakota and of Minnesota and Montana have a very clear choice. The question is which party and which candidate can meet their problems in this state, and meet their in this country. They have heard from the Democratic party and they have heard from the Republican party. I remember when President Truman used to say that the farmers had themselves to blame for their difficulties because they voted Republican in 1952. But I don't hold that view wholly, because in 1952, the farmers were informed that the Republican party stood for 100 percent parity not once but at least three times."
7.63626193689893e-05,0.999923637380631,1574_6,0,"I think the future is going to be a difficult one for us, but I have the greatest confidence in this country.  I have served it in the Congress now for fourteen years, and I must say after traveling to fifty states in the last two years and nearly every section of the United States from the Northwest to the Southeast, I believe that the United States can fulfill its function as the chief defender of freedom in a time of great danger for us all.  A strong defense, a strong economy, a strong society serves not only ourselves but serves freedom."
6.60220748958743e-05,0.999933977925104,1588_5,0,"Exploiting the twin themes of human misery and Yankee hatred, Castro's campaign has met with success in almost every country - in Brazil, where both presidential candidates found it politically expedient to appeal to pro-Castro and anti-American elements in the electorate - in Mexico, where anti-American riots followed pressure on a pro-Castro spokesman - in Guatemala, where Castro-equipped revolutionaries are a real menace - in Uruguay, where a general strike was threatened if Castro was not supported at the San Jose Conference.  And--at the same foreign ministers' conference--the United States suffered one of its few diplomatic defeats in the history of inter-American relations, when it was forced to withdraw its protest over Communist efforts in this hemisphere. This is a critical situation--to find so dangerous an enemy on our very doorstep.  The American people want to know how this was permitted to happen--how the Iron Curtain could have advanced almost to our front yard.  They want to know the truth--and I believe that they are entitled to the truth.  It is not enough to blame it on unknown state department personnel.  Major policy on issues such as Cuban security is made at the highest levels--in the national Security Council and elsewhere--and it is the party in power which must accept full responsibility for this disaster."

I believe in 1960 a new generation of Americans who fought for freedom on all fronts in World War II have now come to where they have a rendezvous with destiny, that their generation must bear its responsibilities of leadership.  I want Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans has assumed the leadership, a generation of Americans that is not satisfied to be second best, that wants to be first, not first, if, but, when, or sometime, but first, period."

6.79632737948266e-05,0.999932036726205,1665_4,0,"Mr. Nixon and I have differed completely on this question.  He says that our prestige is at an all time high.  He said it on the debate and I say it has been declining, and this is an important issue.  Now, this morning the papers reveal, and I have the New York Times in my hand, that the Information Service of our state department has been conducting polls throughout ten countries of the world to try to find out their view of the United States.  These polls have been confidential, but the papers evidently got hold of them.  Here is what the headline says, and it really goes to the whole issue of this campaign: The U.S. Survey Finds That Others Consider the Soviet the Mightiest.  Sub-headline: Summer Poll Shows Belief Is Nearly Unanimous Among the Nations Sampled and the Lead Is Expected to Hold, and Some Expect the Gap to Widen."

Well, why didn't we?  Why did we wait until this summer?  The new continent now, which will bear great influence in the world, is Africa.  Do you know that we brought more foreign students to the United States ten years ago than we do today?  Last year, Guinea asked for 500 teachers.  Do you know how many we sent them?  One.  Do you know there are more students studying here from Thailand than from Africa south of the Sahara?  Do you know that we are about fifteenth or fourteenth or in the world in radio programs to Africa, that we are behind Indonesia?  Do you know that we are fourth in the world behind Radio Cairo in our radio broadcasts from the United States?  Do you know that the Soviet Union spends ten times as much as we do in Spanish broadcasts to Latin America?  This administration is experienced?  I don't think any judge would give a man who had forty accidents a new driver's license.  I don't think an administration which has presided over three recessions in the last eight years, which is now presiding over the lessening of the U.S. position around the world, which has permitted the U.S. image to fade as a vital society, our most important asset, which has in that way damaged the cause of freedom, I cannot believe that any young man or woman who looks to the future can possibly decide to sit down and sit still and look back with Mr. Nixon and the Republican party which has always opposed progress."

Mr. Nixon may be satisfied when we build 30 percent less homes this year than last year, Mr. Nixon and the Republicans may be satisfied to defeat medical care for our older citizens, to prevent and fail to support better education for our children, to make it possible for every bright boy and girl to see the inside of a college and develop his talents. The point of the matter is that the Republican party and Mr. Nixon in his fourteen years of association with it have not stood for progress, have not stood for breaking new ground, have not stood for breaking new frontiers, and I believe in the 1960s, if the United States is going to fulfill its potential, if we are going to fulfill the destiny which is in store for us in the sixties, if we are going to be the leader of freedom, we are going to have to move here at home.  I come to Philadelphia and ask your help in this campaign.  This election is the means to an end, and the end is a great, stronger, and growing America.  I come here to Philadelphia and ask your help.  I can assure you that if we are successful that this state and country will move again."

I made my judgment long ago that the basic issue of this campaign was the question of whether the people of the United States believed it was time they started moving again, that they started going forward again, and that the greatest contribution that they could make to the cause of freedom was to build a strong and vital society here in the United States.  Mr. Nixon has chosen a different road.  He has gone to the American people in the 1960s, in the time of change and revolution, saying, We've never had it so good, saying our prestige in the world has never been higher.  I recall in 1935, when Winston Churchill was warning of the dangers of the Nazi rise, Stanley Baldwin, the leader of the Conservative party, told the people of England that everything was being done in its own good time.  He won that election and England almost lost the war."

And to accomplish these things, we will develop to the fullest the untapped natural resources our water, our minerals, our power with which we are so fortunate to be blessed in this rich land of ours. And we shall provide for our scientists, the support they need for the research that will open exciting new highways into the future--new highways in which we shall have progress which we cannot even dream of today.  And above all, in this decade of the Sixties, this decade of decision and progress, we will witness the continued revitalization of America's moral and spiritual strength with the renewed faith in the eternal ideals of freedom and justice under God which are our priceless heritage as a people."

This great struggle in which we are engaged is not just one of strength of our arms or the productivity of our factories.  That is all it is to the Communists.  That is all it is they have to offer.  But let Americans never forget that we stand for something more than that.  Let Americans never forget that when we were a small nation and a weak nation 170 years ago, that we still were a strong nation in the minds of the world, because our ideals were strong.  What are they?  What do we stand for?  We stand for faith in God.  We stand for belief in dignity of every man, woman and child regardless of his background.

We have a great humanitarian concern, and one of the reasons that we have developed this concern is because of the contribution made by people that make up the mainstream of American life.  Who are they?  They came from all the countries of the world.  Warm-hearted Italians, people from Europe, from Asia, from Africa, these are Americans.

Such efforts toward personal security, first, are right--not only from the humanitarian viewpoint, which all of us will understand--they are mandatory if our complex modern society is to work at its best, at its fullest.  They are essential to our purpose.  And what is that purpose?  I think, summed up in a sentence, it is this: we must lift the ceiling over personal opportunity.  We must strengthen the floor over the pit of personal disaster.  Public policy, therefore, should seek to put right what is wrong in our America, but it should also seek to strengthen what is right.  It should recognize the plain fact that Americans are proud and self-reliant individuals.  Programs that encourage individuals to depend on government are wrong, for increasing dependence by a people upon government is not a sign of strength; it is a sign of weakness, and in this day of competition with the Communists, Americans must be sturdy and strong."

I say this because I have seen the world, because I have had the opportunity to know the problems with which we are confronted, and because I know that the decisions that the next president makes may determine the difference between whether we have peace or war, between whether we have freedom, for ourselves and for the whole world: therefore, I urge all of you to consider the qualifications of the candidates on the basis not simply of the labels you may wear, but on the basis of whether you think what we stand for is best for America."

Now, that doesn't mean that we won't always go the extra mile--and Cabot Lodge and I have some ideas for strengthening the United Nations, for setting up new organizations which can strengthen the cause of peace and freedom throughout the world. But, my friends, I can assure you of this: we are not, under any circumstances, going to enter into any agreements with the Soviet leaders which would surrender freedom any place in the world, because that leads to war and not to peace.

Let us at least draw some meaning that is lasting from their martyrdom. As I said here in Los Angeles last night to a large rally in the streets--I have no careful solutions to offer, and nothing that is strikingly new to say. What needs to be said once more all around the world is Let us stop the killing and stop the killing everywhere. Let us stop it here in our own land before we convince our own children that violence is in fact the normal way of life. Let us stop it while we still have the capacity to love one another as human beings--not just the few people right in our neighborhood, our own families and those around us--but people everywhere who, like us, want their years of happiness and life. But if I have anything to say about the course of events in the years ahead, there is one thing, above all else, that I would like to say and do. I would like to make it possible for a child in the Middle East, or anywhere else around this world, to live a full and secure and happy life before that child dies. I want to try to make it possible for that little girl in Vietnam that we saw running into the arms of the camera lens on fire from Napalm to be blessed by the warmth of love rather than the tragedy of war. I want to try and make it possible for people to live as though we really were created in the image of God rather than in the image of our worst fears and suspicions of each other. So I say Peace--not just now, but peace always. I say Peace--not just in one land, but in every land where there are men and women and children who don't know what it is to see a sunrise or to see trees in the springtime. I see and say Peace--on a planet which gives us life, among people who have no right to take it away from others. And I ask, as I did last night, that you say with me, in the words of that great prayer of St. Francis of Assisi, Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. And then we will reap all of the blessings that we, and the generations before us, had hoped for, and our children will bless us because we have given them the fullness of life.

He was out of there in '91 running for president, the only time they did better than the national average."

Well, I'm not sure I am frustrated, but I'm a little--I don't understand. Vice President Gore goes to a Buddhist temple---where everybody takes a vow of poverty, and comes out with $122,000. And so, good ol' Al, he explains it to the media, Oh, I was on an outreach program. So that will be the end of that. Nobody will look beyond that in the media. That's the end of that one."

There should be no wistful dragging of the feet or turning backward to a dead, irrelevant past.  Government should be competent. Its personnel must not be under the heavy hand of purely political selection or influence. It must not be afraid of raising and spending money for worthy purposes, but it must detest and fear waste and dishonesty as ever present threats to the whole moral basis of government by the consent of the governed because people don't consent voluntarily to be cheated or abused.

Projects and proposals from all parts of the country compete for public investment. I am not sure that the office of president is well enough equipped, as things now stand, to praise them with detachment and critical authority. The Hoover Commission has made suggestions for increasing the effectiveness of executive review; it may be that even better means can be devised, and I propose to find out. "

I had an uncle who lived here in Fresno years ago, and he owned a lot of property around here. I am told he sold it much too soon because what was his ranch is now a major portion of your city.

It seems to me that the American people want to hear about their problems, and that it is the business of the candidates to talk plainly about these issues.

Pending better salaries, I made gifts of money to a few of these men on my immediate staff from political contributions. At least four of these men, while serving me in Springfield, have had offers in private employment of double or more of their state salaries. Some have had financial worries known to me. None ever asked me for help, and none could have been improperly influenced by these gifts, because I gave them and I appointed them to their jobs and I could have discharged them at any time. Two of them have left the state service long since--one to become vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and the other is now a justice of the Illinois State Supreme Court."

It has been accepted by the best men in both parties. No amount of election year talk can obscure that fact. What the campaign has clearly brought out is that the Old Guard of the Republican party wants to scrap that bipartisan foreign policy--and that their candidate with the new look, the General of the Army, has either forsaken his own great past of becoming the policy partner of Senator Taft and some gentlemen of similarly eccentric views about our world."

The issue then was whether the government would help make water available for small farmers who wanted to settle on new land. Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican president, put through that law, and we honor him for it. But as Theodore Roosevelt himself noted in his autobiography, he put the law through over the bitter opposition of the Old Guard Republicans in Congress. He observed that they consistently vote for local and private interests and against the interest of the people as a whole. And note, too that the original Reclamation Law was sponsored in the House of Representatives by Representative Newlands of Nevada, a Democrat. It passed by the votes of 77 Democrats and 69 Republicans."

It gives large scale application to the principle that flood control must begin at the top of the hill where the first trickle of water starts. It is the most important and hopeful attempt thus far made to reduce the crest of floods by holding back more water on the uplands where it falls and by retarding runoff of the remainder. From Virginia to California, from Iowa to Texas, I have seen evidence of America's need for flood control and soil conservation. This is one of the battles that must go forward if we are to build in the United States the fair and fruitful land of our dreams."

Some of my friends here tell me that misunderstanding has been spread deliberately--that many Texans have never had a chance to see or hear the full text of my statement on this issue, and thus to know exactly where I stand on this question--and why. Consequently I want to tell you once more, and on your own home grounds."

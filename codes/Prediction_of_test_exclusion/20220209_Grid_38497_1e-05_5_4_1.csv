Youngstown was not, in 1932, a pleasant place to work or to live--and Youngstown was typical of most of the cities of America. The steel mills here in the Mahoning Valley were working at 31 percent of capacity. One Youngstown working man out of every three was unemployed. There was no unemployment compensation. The other two men worked at poverty wages. There was no minimum wage law. Those men worked in silence beside the furnaces. There was no collective bargaining act. The foreman's word was law. The working man had no seniority rights in his job and there was almost no collective bargaining contracts; almost no unions. At the end of life's work when you could no longer work, there was nothing. There was no social security. You only knew that one day--and you never knew when--there would be a pink dismissal slip in your envelope, and that would be all. If it was bad at the mill, it was infinitely worse in the street and in the home. Youngstown was one of the first cities to start soup kitchens. So desperate indeed did the city of Youngstown become that the City Council..."

Above all, our Democratic platform calls for action on the overshadowing problems of war and peace--the most important unfinished business of our generation--and I mean steady resistance to Communism and patient and persistent efforts to build a peace which has been man's dearest goal from time immemorial. Now, in these few words--if these were all that you knew about me and about our Democratic platform, well, I will have to confess that you wouldn't know very much for it is easy to get up here on a campaign train and say some nice sounding words, but out of our party you get a lot more than some high sounding words--you get first of all the record of twenty years of solid accomplishment, of accomplishment in the interests of all our people, and I hope you will compare this record with the Republican record before you vote--for, by the way, they have a record too during these past twenty years, and it is easy to sum up that record. Whenever there has been a forward looking, a constructive program to oppose, they have opposed it, and that is about all their record amounts to."

America is a great, a strong, a wise, and most of all a good country. And I believe with all my heart that by these qualities, we can and we will safely in God's good time win our way to a peaceful world."

In fighting Communists at home, I shall rely on such experienced guardians of our security as J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and General Bedell Smith of the Central Intelligence Agency. These men fight Communism as it must be fought--with care, thoroughness, precision--and silence."

In all events, I am very grateful to all of you for being here this afternoon. I have just had a most interesting experience.

They are awful keen about this law enforcement, but they continue to use all these devices in their own posts. So it is a little incongruous. They say, By gosh, we are going to clean up crime in this community and get those slot machines out of that corner saloon. But of course, as far as our Legion Post, or VFW, or whatever it is, that belongs to us and it is certainly a different situation. And after all, the device is set to give the fellow at least a sixty to a hundred chance of winning as against one chance in a hundred in the commercial device; and, after all, we own the machine, and it is not owned by a syndicate of operators and placed on a rental basis. And so on and so on."

Such a war is unthinkable and would destroy the very people and the civilization that we seek to save. Yet the day of liberation will come, and there is much we can do in the meantime to help the unhappy people of Eastern Europe. Through the United Nations much is being done to rally the conscience of mankind. We can offer help and encouragement to those thousands of families and those individuals who are escaping, month by month, through the chinks in the Iron Curtain."

This is a brave and a generous country, I think we are bearing our responsibilities well as the strong leader of the free nations against the threat of Soviet communism.  We are doing the hard job that must be done if we are to have a secure place for ourselves and for those children.  We are following out the high ideals of Woodrow Wilson, who wanted to take us our full part--give us our full part--accept our full responsibility for securing the peace back in 1920 after the first World War.  The American people didn't listen to Wilson in those days.  We turned instead to people who led us away from the hard road of international cooperation to the easy  path of isolation.  If we had listened to him we might well have avoided the terrible trial of the second World War, in which 300,000 of our young men died."

They just throw so much confetti at each other, read so many of each other's editorials, and cheer each other's speeches so loudly, that they begin to think that everyone agrees with them. Well, they don't. And I think you can rely on the American people every time to tell who is really talking sense and who isn't. "

I am down here for one purpose--to help get rid of the administration in Washington, an administration that has been living on emergencies and crises, emergencies that it manufactures. It likes the emergencies because out of them it makes the rugs, and a rug is a handy thing under which to sweep the evidence of your own errors and mistakes. That is what we have been doing with emergencies."

In seeking desirable amendments, I will ask the advice and suggestions of all groups--public, management, and labor.  And, gentlemen, I assure you that this invitation of mine will be genuine and in good faith.  It will not be one of those empty theatrical gestures so often made in recent years.  In my own mind I have complete confidence that this job of amending the law can be worked out so that no fair-minded member of your group will consider the results unreasonable.  No such legislation must ever be regarded as final, and in considering amendments to labor legislation, labor will have an equal voice.  It is the American way to take what we have and constantly seek to make it better."

I think that the administration in Washington has gone too far in damaging, indeed leading toward destruction of the kind of America we have known, loved and believe in.  That administration has not led us intelligently toward peace.  It is spending more than it earns.  Indeed, it earns nothing.  It is spending more than it takes from us in the highest taxes we have ever had, and leaves a deficit in the budget that further cheapens our money."

But then I think of you people who work not only on an intensive basis like that part of the time, but all the time, keeping the party together, keeping it financed, keeping it presented properly before all the people, and I realize what public service really means.  It is not just the limelight, although sometimes these lights are pretty bright, at that.  It is the day by day chore."

Now, in this crowd, ladies and gentlemen, there are numbers of men who are my old comrades in arms.  Some of them may have fought in the Far Pacific; some may have had duties that kept them in the U.S.; many of them went abroad with me.  And I used to see those fellows along the roads, in the camps, sometimes at reviews, in their barracks, in their kitchen, wherever; and we used to talk about why we were fighting.  And we came to the agreement in simple terms that we were fighting to keep America the kind of land that we believe it to be--a land of freedom and opportunity, not a land dominated by a Hitler or by any group of bureaucrats.  The reason I am in this political campaign, my friends, is in a continuation of that promise.  I am trying to do my part to keep America the kind of country we have always known, which means first of all that you must have a government you can respect and other nations will likewise respect it because you do."

It is the day that marked the adoption of the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution.  In that Bill of Rights it specifies what are the rights of human beings as opposed to the power of government, the limits of what government can do to the individual today, and those ten amendments, possibly coupled with the organization our forefathers gave us, is the real genius of American government.  When those rights, any one of them, comes in peril from within or any threat from without, it is time for every loyal American, not just the rich, not just the farmers, not just the workmen, but everybody.  It is time for every loyal American to rise up, take a look, gird himself for battle, and fight off the encroachment."

Of course, it's possible--though I doubt it--that the Savannah River, itself, has its source in a Washington Bureau. This, my friends, is a good year for some straight political thinking.  It is a bad year to be fooled.  It would be a particularly bad year to be fooled into thinking that the Washington mess is the fault of you, the people.  And we will not be fooled into the belief that this great land of ours and the progress we have achieved here are blessings handed down by government.  We are going to think straight--straight through to the conclusion that America is what free Americans--with courage and sweat and drive--have made it.  "

It should be remembered that the negative votes on the North Atlantic Treaty, the Vandenberg Resolution and the Marshall Plan included negative votes of the party in power.  That is a tribute not just to a man but to a party.  Senator Vandenberg, if he were living, would be the first one to resent the suggestion that the votes to which I refer represented a personal triumph.  Rather, they represented to him the dedication of a party which, although it was an opposition party, subordinated partisan considerations to the national welfare."

Well, some things are so false you don't know the right words to use, at least in polite society, for condemning them.  I went to Kasson and on behalf of Republican leaders, and with the concurrence of the great men of the party, at least all that could be reached in time, I stated exactly what we meant to do, and the present 90 percent parity price in the farm program was sustained and supported completely.  Moreover, we pledge that these programs in the future, as it comes time for them to be revised and brought up to date as all programs must be, it will be farmers that will be brought in to Washington whose counsel and advice will not only be sought but, it will be heed."

Now, there are obviously many things that Washington must come in and help if we are going to develop this great West the way it must be developed--and that means to the limit of its capacity to absorb development--but when they do come in, the federal government must come in as a partner; they must take seriously and earnestly the advice and the counsel of the people who are on the spot, and if we don't do that the West will never be developed as it should be. The crusade upon which we are now embarked has that as one of its purposes--in every section, to pay respect, to give due influence to the knowledge and information that local people have on their own problems and not try to do these things from Washington."

If you believe that as I do, will you join our crusade? This crusade which I have taken to the American people represents what I, myself, believe.  I have acted and I have spoken from my own deep inner convictions of what is best and right for America.  I have been steadfast to my convictions.  I have made no deals.  I am still a no deal man.

This party in power in the last seven years has used up every possible political promise there is, and some of them have gotten pretty shopworn.  For example, there is no easier way to duck an issue than to say this, I will promise you a law, well knowing they cannot deliver it.  There is no easier way to get out of a situation.  What I promise you is work, never ending work, to make certain that justice is done.  So I cannot come before you with the competition of promises, but I do come before you with a pledge, and this is the pledge.  If you want to put this crusade at the helm of your government; if you want to substitute for these 22 caliber men who are trying to hold 45 caliber jobs the finest men and women that we can draw from all sections of this country, from every walk of life--and let me say plainly, based upon merit and without respect to color or creed; if you want to have a government of that kind, then you belong in this crusade."

But good intentions are not good enough and the country is stalled on dead center--stalled in the middle of the road--while the world goes whirling by. America, which has lifted man to his highest economic state, which has saved freedom in war and peace, which saved collective security, no longer sparks and flames and gives off new ideas and initiatives. Our lights are dimmed. We chat complacently of this and that while, in Carlyle's phrase, Death and eternity sit glaring. And I could add that opportunity, neglected opportunity, sits glaring too!"

Today, the record makes it clear that this has not been done--and circumstances make it certain that it will not be done in the four years ahead. It was not, as some sought to suggest, the habit of the past that sustained your faith in the Democratic party in 1952. It was rather your vision of the future.

Nor do airlines, for example, complain of the assistance they get as mail carrier. The private power companies--surely among the most active critics of governmental activity--have no objection to the billions of dollars worth of government financed and directed research, experiment, and pioneer construction which is being made available free to the private builders of atomic power plants.

And I want to say something, too, about another kind of indifference. I mean about the crisis in education in this country.

I think the people of this country do not view the vice presidency-- at least in these times-- as a casual incident. They know what the vice presidency is this nation's life insurance policy.

I think we need an administration which so regards it. We spend $42 billion on defense every year. Those ships sail the oceans. They protect us but they do not serve our people and the world. I do not regard the distribution of food around the world as a great burden upon us. I regard it as an opportunity, to use our assets in a way which will attract people to the cause of freedom. I am glad that this is our problem, and not starvation. I am glad we can produce more than we can consume, if we share it usefully, for we are our brother's keeper; and if we have great assets in this country, I believe we should hold out the hand of friendship.

I think the farmers of North Dakota and the farmers of South Dakota and of Minnesota and Montana have a very clear choice.

I remember when President Truman used to say that the farmers had themselves to blame for their difficulties because they voted Republican in 1952. But I don't hold that view wholly, because in 1952, the farmers were informed that the Republican party stood for 100 percent parity not once but at least three times."

The very fact that he chooses that as his campaign indicates that he could not suddenly reverse in 1961 and determine on action.  If he really believes these things he says, in my opinion he disqualifies himself.  If he does not believe them, and runs on that program, he makes the same mistake that Stanley Baldwin made in England in 1935 which almost destroyed Great Britain, by misleading the people of England in 1935.

In that position paper he called for greater emphasis on middle-income housing and he voted against that in 1950.  He calls for a greater flow of housing credit so that the American people can buy houses at low rates of interest.  But he neglects to mention his vote as vice president to increase the interest rates on the GI housing bans.  High interest rates never built a single home and one of the reasons why we are building 200,000 less homes each year than we should to keep up with our population increase is because of the high interest rate policy of this administration."

I will talk about real ideas: of making health care available to the poorest of the poor, controlling what you pay when you go to a doctor; about reforming welfare, giving our kids what they deserve, the world's very best schools. My policies will strengthen the most important institution in our nation, and I am talking about the American family. The liberals are trying to back us away from discussing how to strengthen the family, and we are going to stay with it.

For it is a very solemn hour indeed, freighted with the hopes and fears of millions of mankind who see in us, the Democratic Party, sober understanding of the breadth and depth of the revolutionary currents in the world. Here and abroad they see in us awareness that there is no turning back, that, as Justice Holmes said, We must sail sometimes with the wind, sometimes against it; but we must sail and not drift or lie at anchor. They see in us, the Democratic Party that has steered this country through a storm of spears for twenty years, an understanding of a world in the torment of transition from an age that has died to an age struggling to be born. They see in us relentless determination to stand fast against the barbarian at the gate, to cultivate allies with a decent respect for the opinion of others, to patiently explore every misty path to peace and security, which is the only certainty of lower taxes and a better life."

I don't know how the peace conference got along but they had a good time criticizing us for everything, as usual. They even accused me of the crime of visiting President Truman the other day--a crime that hasn't been committed since Rutherford B. Hayes, because the party in power has not nominated a candidate who was neither a member of Congress nor the Cabinet in seventy-five years. I thought I detected an explanation of their difficulty in finding something to say, however, when the orator of the day, Senator Nixon, revealed that out at the camp in Colorado, General Eisenhower's vacation headquarters, they ate fried mush most of the time.

Now, in a way, I sympathize with his plight; for some time I have been wondering when he was going to find something to say that would not offend one of the Republican parties.

America is a great, a strong, a wise, and most of all a good country. And I believe with all my heart that by these qualities, we can and we will safely in God's good time win our way to a peaceful world."

They were merely beautifying the state highway at the access point of the city, where it began to come into the city. And where it had been shabby and ugly and messy they were cleaning it up around there and developing a picnic area--that sort of thing--and an infinite variety of things. Also, of course, from the point of view of the public official, it is a wonderful access point to communities."

And one reason for this is that it has become harder and harder instead of easier and easier to tell precisely what the Republican party stands for in this campaign. I confess it is early in the morning to be harsh about anybody and to be very critical of anybody. I don't want to be critical or harsh. I have in mind that we are now only a week from our election and we still don't know precisely what the Republicans propose to do about much of anything. We know where they stand on the matter of a new labor relations law, for example. That is precisely where they stood for the past five years. That is an old Republican position."

When so many people get up so early in the morning to hear about the great issues on which we will make a decision next Tuesday, we can all feel confident that the future of America rests in responsible hands. It is a sign that every one of you is taking seriously your duty as a citizen; for, in our country it is the people who make all of the final decisions."

Many thousands of our votes will come from rank-and-file Republicans who will vote with us. No doubt some Democrats will vote for the Republican candidates. We have already, for example, traded a couple of southern governors for the senator from Oregon and the vice chairman of the National Young Republicans. And I regard this as a profitable exchange for us. I would be happy to throw in a second baseman--but not Jackie Robinson."

And I thank them every one for the reception they have given me--for their infinite courtesy and their heartening friendliness.  I have asked you for your support for my candidacy. I ask you now for support of our common faith in this country. The confidence we've inherited is our greatest wealth, the source of our strength. "

Once we have gotten that thought in our minds so that we never forget it, ladies and gentlemen, we can clean out corruption.  Why, think of it, think of the votes we can roll up on November 4th.  We can bring down taxes; we can stop the terrific taxes that are piling up your prices.  An economist came into me the other day, one of these fellows, you know, that dig out the facts.  Every time you eat a boiled egg, unless you raise it yourself, you pay 100 taxes on that egg, one hundred taxes and then we wonder where the prices come from."

Now, in this crowd, ladies and gentlemen, there are numbers of men who are my old comrades in arms.  Some of them may have fought in the Far Pacific; some may have had duties that kept them in the U.S.; many of them went abroad with me.  And I used to see those fellows along the roads, in the camps, sometimes at reviews, in their barracks, in their kitchen, wherever; and we used to talk about why we were fighting.  And we came to the agreement in simple terms that we were fighting to keep America the kind of land that we believe it to be--a land of freedom and opportunity, not a land dominated by a Hitler or by any group of bureaucrats.  The reason I am in this political campaign, my friends, is in a continuation of that promise.  I am trying to do my part to keep America the kind of country we have always known, which means first of all that you must have a government you can respect and other nations will likewise respect it because you do."

Your governor, your new Senator, your Congressman--we must have them all--and with them and on behalf of all Republicans, I make these pledges to labor, to farmers, to businessmen, to every American:  first, if you want to change administrations this fall, if you want the group that the Republicans can put in the administration and in the Senate and in the House to take charge of this thing--clean it out and start us on a different road than we are now following--then they promise this:  There will be fairness, decency and justice prevailing in that administration, and they will serve you honestly as your servants and will not attempt to be your master.  That is the first pledge they make."

You give me a chance to look in your faces, to bring you a word of greeting, and to give you one or two of the thoughts that are on my mind as we go through this political campaign.  I have had a wonderful day and a half in your state, starting up at Sacramento.  It seems to me I have been covering ground very rapidly and every place there seems to be a new surprise.  Now, for example, here when the so-called professional politicians began to give me my lessons in this new art a few months back, they told me there was one thing you could not do-go to an airport and address a group of American citizens.  I was told they simply wouldn't come.  So I find out today that at least in Long Beach those political friends of mine were wrong, and I am delighted."

They will be consulted, and not the way they are consulted now:  You do this or you will get no more.  They will be consulted on what is the problem of their locality.  We have no intention in this crusade of getting a bunch of long-haired Brannan experts to come out and run your farms.  We figure you can do it a little better."

This is the faith--not in the fiction of the abstract common man, but in the wondrous fact that every man is an uncommon man.  He is the infinitely precious, utterly unique individual of living flesh, whose spirit has such strength that he can endure and survive oppression and poverty, disease and imprisonment, to keep alive his soul's love of freedom."

Today, the White House, the State Department, the International Trade Section of the Department of Commerce, the Treasury Department, the Mutual Security Administration, the Point IV planners, the Pentagon, and the international business enterprises go their several, uncoordinated, though well-meaning ways.  Without impinging upon the rights and responsibilities of private enterprise, including private investors, we must coordinate and mobilize mutually-beneficial economic cooperation, as effectively as we mobilize for military defense."

We can preserve the position of the small business without injury to the large. We can strengthen labor unions and collective bargaining as vital institutions in a free economy. We can and our party history proves that we will!"
9.12301923928992e-05,0.999908769807607,1364_8,0,"Does the President really object to his administration being called indifferent to unemployment? I remind him that his Secretary of Defense talked about workers out of jobs as kennel or hunting dogs, and that it was a White House assistant who said of unemployment this spring that the right to suffer is one of the joys of a free economy. And I want to say something, too, about another kind of indifference. I mean about the crisis in education in this country. The President said last night that twice in his State of the Union messages--in 1955 and 1956--he urged swift action--and that he even called a conference on education."

If that means anything, it means they should get parity without price supports. And if that is what Mr. Eisenhower meant, why didn't he say so four years ago? He didn't say so because he knew that any such statement would have cost him."

You have set for yourselves, indeed, a most worthy objective: to help promote an American continental neighborhood.

There are new and more terrible weapons--new and uncertain nations--new pressures of population and deprivation. One-third of the world, it has been said, may be free--but one-third is the victim of cruel repression--and the other one-third is rocked by the pangs of poverty, hunger, and envy. More energy is released by the awakening of these new nations than by the fission of the atom itself."

But I trust that no one in this vast assemblage will agree with those sentiments. For the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won--and we stand today on the edge of a new frontier--the frontier of the 1960s--a frontier of unknown opportunities and perils--a frontier of unfulfilled hopes and threats."

I don't think there is any man in this century who has written more significant legislation of benefit to the people than Speaker Rayburn. He does it. He secures the support of the members of the House of Representatives from all states of the Union. He secures the undeviating loyalty of the majority leader from Massachusetts, John McCormack, his strong right arm, because they know that he speaks not only for Bonham, Texas; he speaks for the United States. And Lyndon Johnson, unanimously chosen on three different occasions by every senator of the United States in the Democratic Party to be the majority leader, was chosen because he was not only a senator from Texas, but a senator of the United States."

I lived with it for a month in West Virginia. I spent some time in McDowell County, West Virginia, which mines more coal than it ever did in history, more coal than any county in the United States, and has more people getting surplus packages from our government than any county in the United States. What is true of McDowell County and true of the coal industry will be true of other industries stretching across the United States. This is going to be a problem for the next president of the United States. These problems which I now discuss and mention, the problem of an abundant agriculture and an inability to distribute it effectively, all of these problems are so-called domestic problems."

But I want to say one or two things. I spoke this afternoon at the plowing contest on what I consider to be the number one domestic problem which the United States faces, and that is the sharp decline in agricultural income. I think the farmers of North Dakota and the farmers of South Dakota and of Minnesota and Montana have a very clear choice. The question is which party and which candidate can meet their problems in this state, and meet their in this country. They have heard from the Democratic party and they have heard from the Republican party. I remember when President Truman used to say that the farmers had themselves to blame for their difficulties because they voted Republican in 1952. But I don't hold that view wholly, because in 1952, the farmers were informed that the Republican party stood for 100 percent parity not once but at least three times."

It is certainly the same Mr. Khrushchev. He represents the same Communist system--still dedicated to achieving world domination. He maintains the same objectives, the same views, and essentially the same tactics."

Mr. Nixon said later this week that that statement was false.  He boasts of tremendous power development during the past eight years, and he asserted that the Russians can overtake us only if we did nothing for fifteen years, while they built eight Grand Coulee Dams a year.  That is his charge and what are the facts?  The facts were reported last year by a committee of the U.S. Senate, over which Mr. Nixon occasionally presides.  That committee's findings, and I quote, were Although the United States is still far ahead, the Russians could overtake us in 1975, in fifteen years, unless we speed up or they slow down.  Both countries will have, the Senate said, an equal power generating capacity which will be 337,500,000 kilowatts in 1975."

We are a little softer than they used to be. I want to thank you very much for a generous reception.  I am particularly proud that I am associated on the ticket here in Minnesota with your distinguished congressman who has served this district and served the country, Joe Karth, whom I know you are going to send back to the House of Representatives and with your great governor, Orville Freeman, who was generous enough to nominate me at the convention.  But that is not the reason you ought to reelect him.  The reason you ought to reelect him is because he has served this state, and I don't know of a more difficult job in the United States than to be governor of an expanding atate with problems of education, taking care of our older people, the mentally retarded and all the rest.  I think Orville Freeman has moved forward with courage.  I am confident that this State is going to respond to that kind of leadership."

I have the greatest confidence in the United States.  I am not satisfied to see it second best in any area of national and international life.  I want an America that is not first, if; not first, but; not first, when; but first, period, and I think we can do it.  I believe that this generation of Americans has the same rendezvous with destiny as that generation of Americans in 1936 to whom Franklin Roosevelt addressed those words, that that generation had a rendezvous with destiny.  I believe we do, too.  The rendezvous was the question of whether freedom could be maintained here in the United States.  Our destiny is to determine whether freedom can be maintained throughout the world, whether a house divided against itself can survive, whether a world can exist half slave and half free."

Roosevelt, who was running in 1920 for the vice presidency of the United States, with Governor Cox of Ohio.  Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt then journeyed to Washington, D.C., and went to see Woodrow Wilson, sick, aging, and at the end of his career.  After Woodrow Wilson talked for a few minutes however, with great feeling and great fire of his desire for a unified world and a world of peace, Governor Cox broke in and said, We are behind you 100 percent, and they fought that campaign in part to implement the ideal of Woodrow Wilson for the establishment of the League of Nations, and lost.  But Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt, in losing that election in 1920, held before themselves and the people their concept of the service that they can render in an election, of attempting to turn the attention of the people to the great issues that face us, and the great possibilities that lie in action in the future.  And I believe in this election 40 years later, we merely do not run for office, but we also seek to establish a basic point, that what this country is now doing is not good enough, that in the 1960s, if we are going to maintain our freedom, if we are going to meet our commitments at home and abroad, we have to do better, and that is the basic issue which has separated Mr. Nixon and myself."

Now, as the market price drops so drops the support price.  Where you had $1.50 for corn eight years ago, you may be getting 90 cents for corn today, or 93 cents.  That is the market price.  Mr. Nixon will pay you 90 percent of that market price next year, and if it drops to 85 cents, he will pay you 90 percent of that, and that is the step, down, down, down, until farmers are driven off their farms in increasing numbers."

Having seen him four times close up in this campaign and made up, I would not accuse Mr. Nixon of being barefaced, but I think the American people next Tuesday can determine who is telling the truth.  Mr. Nixon may tell us to forget the Republican party, he may tell us that he speaks for all the people, but I don't think the people of this state of New Mexico and the people of the United States are going to forget the record of the Republican party which he so well represents.

And to accomplish these things, we will develop to the fullest the untapped natural resources our water, our minerals, our power with which we are so fortunate to be blessed in this rich land of ours. And we shall provide for our scientists, the support they need for the research that will open exciting new highways into the future--new highways in which we shall have progress which we cannot even dream of today.

First, of course, and we will all agree with this, America must have military strength which is not only second to none, but strength which, combined with our allies, is sufficient, that regardless of what a potential enemy may have, that if he should launch a surprise attack against us anyplace in the world we will have enough left to destroy his warmaking capability. Why do I set that particular standard?  Not because we ever want to use that strength, because if we have that strength it means that is the greatest single guarantee that a potential enemy of peace will not use his strength against us."

Yes, yes, we march, we marched for Franklin Roosevelt out of the dark days of the Depression when he said that all we had to fear was fear itself and we marched right on through that Depression and America went on to win a great victory not only over a Depression, but in World War II and we marched with Harry Truman, who told it just like it was and he did something about it, too, for all of us, and we marched and we marched with John F. Kennedy who stood before you eight years ago and said these words to you:  I would like it to be said that in our administration, our country moved, but special emphasis on education, took care of our children and gave medical care to the aged and that we ended discrimination of all kinds in the United States.

That's why we are proud to be Democrats.

It has gone up 9.3, one-tenth of 1 percent more, since 1961 to 1968.  The cost of services, however, has gone up appreciably in the cost of living index.

There was a general consensus among Republicans and Democrats alike, from Richard Nixon to Jimmy Carter, that something had to be done about it, that the national government had to respond to it, that there were differences in kinds of response, but most people acknowledged even then that the path that had been taken in the past would not be enough to steer America into a global economy."

You today accept the fact that, in the private free enterprise system which we all recognize as basic to our liberty and our prosperity, employees can prosper only as their employers do, and that irresponsible demands are only self-defeating. Yet American labor, like the Democratic party, faces new and uncharted tomorrows. You, as we, will be challenged anew to measure up to the demands of both freedom and power. The future of democracy, perhaps the future of our world, depends upon the exercise of power by America's private and public bodies alike with that self-restraint which separates power from tyranny and orderfrom chaos."

Those who let their politics impeach their honesty tell you that inflation is the product of governmental waste and mismanagement. Whether this is legitimate politics I shall not presume to say. But as an explanation of the causes of inflation, it is pure poppycock. It's like a husband coming into the kitchen, seeing one potato peeling that is too thick, and exploding that now he knows why you can't make ends meet. I'm for the government's peeling its potatoes with a sharp knife and a miserly eye. And I've done some sharp and miserly peeling in Illinois myself.

You remember the bitter winters of 1930 and 1931. Farmers in Arkansas--conservative, law-abiding farmers--organized to march on towns and loot the stores. Children left home to spare their parents another mouth to feed; so many of them left that the railroads put on special open boxcars to keep the kids from breaking into the closed ones. Millions of American men and women waited in the breadlines. An army of ragged veterans actually marched on our national capital."

One is peace and the other is prosperity.  And it is clear, too, that the position of the two parties on these issues is exactly the same as it has been for the last twenty years.

The Democrats are for peace and prosperity too, and we have been doing something about it and we are going to go on doing something about it. "

Youngstown was not, in 1932, a pleasant place to work or to live--and Youngstown was typical of most of the cities of America. The steel mills here in the Mahoning Valley were working at 31 percent of capacity. One Youngstown working man out of every three was unemployed. There was no unemployment compensation. The other two men worked at poverty wages. There was no minimum wage law. Those men worked in silence beside the furnaces. There was no collective bargaining act. The foreman's word was law. The working man had no seniority rights in his job and there was almost no collective bargaining contracts; almost no unions. At the end of life's work when you could no longer work, there was nothing. There was no social security. You only knew that one day--and you never knew when--there would be a pink dismissal slip in your envelope, and that would be all. If it was bad at the mill, it was infinitely worse in the street and in the home. Youngstown was one of the first cities to start soup kitchens. So desperate indeed did the city of Youngstown become that the City Council..."

Above all, our Democratic platform calls for action on the overshadowing problems of war and peace--the most important unfinished business of our generation--and I mean steady resistance to Communism and patient and persistent efforts to build a peace which has been man's dearest goal from time immemorial. Now, in these few words--if these were all that you knew about me and about our Democratic platform, well, I will have to confess that you wouldn't know very much for it is easy to get up here on a campaign train and say some nice sounding words, but out of our party you get a lot more than some high sounding words--you get first of all the record of twenty years of solid accomplishment, of accomplishment in the interests of all our people, and I hope you will compare this record with the Republican record before you vote--for, by the way, they have a record too during these past twenty years, and it is easy to sum up that record. Whenever there has been a forward looking, a constructive program to oppose, they have opposed it, and that is about all their record amounts to."

And somewhere in this process America has fundamentally changed--a new view, a new compassion, a new faith has emerged. In a way it is a moral revival, and it has altered the tone and the meaning of our life. And how different a prospect faces a young man or a young woman of today from what faced the youth of my generation. The only or, most of all, the go-getter was the hero. Few cared about politics or public service -almost none who went through school or college with me took any positive interest in that, or have subsequently. Few had the sense of civil or social responsibility that we find today, when they were young."

In all events, I am very grateful to all of you for being here this afternoon. I have just had a most interesting experience. I was presented on the rear platform of the train with an enormous placard--here it is--they are all of the Ike buttons, gathered by the Volunteers for Stevenson from people who have switched."

Each needs a special sort of ministry. Let us remember that, while Christ preached the doctrine of eternal salvation, he also did the work that needed to be done in the kingdom of man. He healed the sick, fed the poor, sustained the weak, and sheltered all those who were in want. So must we, I think, as Americans continue prudently to extend to the needy of this earth that material help which we almost alone can give. And we ought to do this not grudgingly, but with a clear recognition that it is far better to give than to receive. In a word, the first answer to Communism is not a lesser, but a fuller application of Judaic- Christian ethics to the neighborhood of nations around us."

Such a war is unthinkable and would destroy the very people and the civilization that we seek to save. Yet the day of liberation will come, and there is much we can do in the meantime to help the unhappy people of Eastern Europe. Through the United Nations much is being done to rally the conscience of mankind. We can offer help and encouragement to those thousands of families and those individuals who are escaping, month by month, through the chinks in the Iron Curtain."

That is why one can believe that the importance of bolstering our defenses by the foreign aid programs--Point Four, and things of that kind--are essential if we are going to hope to frustrate the designs of this godless tyranny throughout the world. I thank you so much for affording me this opportunity of participating even briefly in the ceremonies. I count you very fortunate indeed to have this splendid housing development in your neighborhood; and I can add that I am very jealous of it. I should like to be participating in a similar project in Chicago where we too have desperate need of the advantages of public housing."

I think we must sweep out of the corridors of government, at all levels, national and state, those lingering suspicions which are a holdover from an earlier and very different time.  This is a problem which concerns me very deeply, for I am convinced that both government and business must learn to live together in harmony, before an era of bad temper turns into something infinitely worse. We must avoid at all costs the bitter struggle of class against class, which results inevitably in a drift either to the extreme left or to the extreme right. And you and I know that either kind of drift would end up at the same dreadful destination: a police state with all of the horrors that we have seen in Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia. "

Many thousands of our votes will come from rank-and-file Republicans who will vote with us. No doubt some Democrats will vote for the Republican candidates. We have already, for example, traded a couple of southern governors for the senator from Oregon and the vice chairman of the National Young Republicans. And I regard this as a profitable exchange for us. I would be happy to throw in a second baseman--but not Jackie Robinson."

You people pitched in on your own.  You didn't even wait for a Washington bureaucrat to come down and do it.  You did it yourselves.  Moreover, I am told what you could expect in that little incident, that the elephant stayed on the job working until the last and the donkey played out--just too old, too tired."

If we do not stop that kind of thing, ladies and gentlemen, then America cannot be what it has been in the past.  We must have a solvent America, an America that lives within its means, yet so far have they gone with these spendthrift policies that the government itself says that last year every city family had to spend $400 more than that family could earn to pay for its shelter, its food, its clothing and other necessities in the family.  If that goes on, not only is this government going to be broke but all the families in it are going to be broke.  That is not America."

Now, in this crowd, ladies and gentlemen, there are numbers of men who are my old comrades in arms.  Some of them may have fought in the Far Pacific; some may have had duties that kept them in the U.S.; many of them went abroad with me.  And I used to see those fellows along the roads, in the camps, sometimes at reviews, in their barracks, in their kitchen, wherever; and we used to talk about why we were fighting.  And we came to the agreement in simple terms that we were fighting to keep America the kind of land that we believe it to be--a land of freedom and opportunity, not a land dominated by a Hitler or by any group of bureaucrats.  The reason I am in this political campaign, my friends, is in a continuation of that promise.  I am trying to do my part to keep America the kind of country we have always known, which means first of all that you must have a government you can respect and other nations will likewise respect it because you do."

Your governor, your new Senator, your Congressman--we must have them all--and with them and on behalf of all Republicans, I make these pledges to labor, to farmers, to businessmen, to every American:  first, if you want to change administrations this fall, if you want the group that the Republicans can put in the administration and in the Senate and in the House to take charge of this thing--clean it out and start us on a different road than we are now following--then they promise this:  There will be fairness, decency and justice prevailing in that administration, and they will serve you honestly as your servants and will not attempt to be your master.  That is the first pledge they make."

Measures to deceive them worked so effectively that they estimated our original strength in Europe at seventy-five divisions instead of the actual thirty-six. In the entire American record in Europe there is no single instance where the enemy gained essential information of our plans through the medium of spies or subversive agents."
9.25031727994022e-05,0.9999074968272,1197_12,0,"Then we are accused of wanting to abolish the farm program and the price support.  Well, some things are so false you don't know the right words to use, at least in polite society, for condemning them.  I went to Kasson and on behalf of Republican leaders, and with the concurrence of the great men of the party, at least all that could be reached in time, I stated exactly what we meant to do, and the present 90 percent parity price in the farm program was sustained and supported completely.  Moreover, we pledge that these programs in the future, as it comes time for them to be revised and brought up to date as all programs must be, it will be farmers that will be brought in to Washington whose counsel and advice will not only be sought but, it will be heed."

It is in the record as to what the Republican Party expects to do, purposes to do, with price supports, with REA, with cooperatives, with all of those things that mean so much to farm life today.  And that means perishable products as well as nonperishables.  So all of this talk about the Republican Party trying to put the farmer in the poor house is about as weak an argument as they could develop.  They say we want to abolish good times, that everybody will be out with a tin cup on the bread lines.  I made a talk the other night at Peoria where I took to pieces this so-called Democrat prosperity to show that the only advance in living standards the American people have made in the last 20 years was during the five years of World War II.  I do not believe that America wants a prosperity that is based upon the risks and sacrifices that men have to make in uniform against an enemy."

Those Americans, of course, are largely our new babies born.

By this I mean the actual cost in dollars is something that you have to add onto all these wasteful and extravagant expenses, as well as the necessary expenses.  But the great damage done to us by corruption in government is, after all, not just the few dollars it takes out of our tax revenues and our pockets.  This mess in Washington lowers our prestige abroad and robs us of pride in our own government.  If we are going to restore pride in government, who is going to do it?  You can't take an organization that has been in power far too long and merely by doing a little face-lifting job, doing a little repaint job, get by with it.  Actually, I believe that the administration candidate said all it needed was a little refreshening.  But as far as I am concerned, how do you refreshen a bad egg?"

You give me a chance to look in your faces, to bring you a word of greeting, and to give you one or two of the thoughts that are on my mind as we go through this political campaign.  I have had a wonderful day and a half in your state, starting up at Sacramento.  It seems to me I have been covering ground very rapidly and every place there seems to be a new surprise.  Now, for example, here when the so-called professional politicians began to give me my lessons in this new art a few months back, they told me there was one thing you could not do-go to an airport and address a group of American citizens.  I was told they simply wouldn't come.  So I find out today that at least in Long Beach those political friends of mine were wrong, and I am delighted."

There was a military estimate made in September 1947 by military men, and it had this conclusion: The military occupation of South Korea is not essential to the military security of the United States of America."

No agency, public or private, has been more effective in arousing the hearts and minds of the plain people of the Free World to an awareness of the menace.

The agency that looked at tomorrow's needs for minerals has been disbanded--and nothing put in its place. The Soil Conservation Service has been weakened--and must be revived.

This train is headed not only south, but it is headed toward Washington.  I think in many ways the election of 1960 comes at a time more dangerous for our country, more trying for all of us, a period of greater responsibility for every citizen than any election since the election of 1860.  In that time, as you recall, the great issue was whether this country could stay united, whether it would, in the words of Lincoln, exist half slave and half free.  The issue in the election of 1960 involves not only the well-being of the people of this valley, involves not only the development of your natural resources, but as citizens of the United States and leaders of the free world, we must be concerned about such far-off places as the Congo, India, and Indonesia, the security of those countries, as well as the well-being of their people."

He secures the undeviating loyalty of the majority leader from Massachusetts, John McCormack, his strong right arm, because they know that he speaks not only for Bonham, Texas; he speaks for the United States.

But I want to say one or two things. I spoke this afternoon at the plowing contest on what I consider to be the number one domestic problem which the United States faces, and that is the sharp decline in agricultural income. I think the farmers of North Dakota and the farmers of South Dakota and of Minnesota and Montana have a very clear choice. The question is which party and which candidate can meet their problems in this state, and meet their in this country. They have heard from the Democratic party and they have heard from the Republican party. I remember when President Truman used to say that the farmers had themselves to blame for their difficulties because they voted Republican in 1952. But I don't hold that view wholly, because in 1952, the farmers were informed that the Republican party stood for 100 percent parity not once but at least three times."

He boasts of tremendous power development during the past eight years, and he asserted that the Russians can overtake us only if we did nothing for fifteen years, while they built eight Grand Coulee Dams a year.  That is his charge and what are the facts?  The facts were reported last year by a committee of the U.S. Senate, over which Mr. Nixon occasionally presides.  That committee's findings, and I quote, were Although the United States is still far ahead, the Russians could overtake us in 1975, in fifteen years, unless we speed up or they slow down.

What are the issues in this campaign that any voter should consider before they vote?  In my judgment they are two: first, there is the point of view expressed by the Vice President that this country has never been stronger, that our security is assured, that we are experiencing and enjoying unprecedented prosperity from one end of the country to the other, and that the way to win the peace is by journeys through Eastern Europe in order to inform them of the value of freedom.  I want to make it clear that Mr. Nixon may decide, if he is elected, to go to Eastern Europe, but I am going to Washington, D.C., because that is the place.

Why do I set that particular standard?

The thing that ran through my mind I'm sure was what would run through your mind--that the most important question and the most important responsibility for the next president of the United States is to see that those boys and thousands like them are always in uniforms of peace and never have to be in uniforms of war. And so I say to you today that the most important responsibility of the next president is to keep the peace without surrender and that is the question you should ask--which of the candidates--which of the two for president and vice president will best provide that leadership.

So, first, because he is a man who understands power and respects it, because he is a man who will use power if he can get away with it, to accomplish his ends, we must make sure that he never believes he is strong enough and that we are weak enough that he could start something without risking national suicide on his own part.

He knew that if he didn't go in war would probably be sure because the Communists would sweep down through the Middle East. So, finally, he turned to me. He said, We have got to go in. We went in.

You know, the easy thing to do is to come to a state like this and say to you: the federal government is going to take over all of your problems. The federal government is going to promise you this, that, and the other thing. As a matter of fact, it's rather interesting that when we look at this campaign, it's had a rather amusing twist in a sense because, as you notice, the slogan that our opposition is using: Kennedy is the remedy. Well, you know, that's like the old medicine man who used to come to town--the same remedy for everything--spend more money--and that's your money. Now, the difference was, you know, that the medicine man had the same remedy--different labels on the bottle--it would cure snakebite or rheumatism or anything else, but it really didn't do it; and the difference was the medicine man always got out of town just before the people caught up with the fact that the remedy didn't work.

Our plan would make adequate insurance available at no cost--or at a very low cost--for these families, families who work rather than who go on welfare."

The average teacher in America today starts at about $14,000 or $13,000 a year.  In some states it's far less.  I was in Florida a year ago, and I saw a teacher's schedule that showed a teacher who had twenty years of teaching with a doctorate degree made $17,000 a year.  I may be off a couple thousand, but I remember being shocked by the figure.  I have talked to any number of young people who went into teaching full of hope and found out they just couldn't stick with it, couldn't afford it.  I talked to a young man in New Hampshire.  I don't think he voted for me based on the returns, but we had a nice conversation.  He told me that, more than anything, he wanted to be a science teacher.  But he had a family of two kids, he was now thirty-six years of age.  He said, I couldn't do it.  I had to get out.  And I made double or triple whatever it was in the private sector.  What is happening today is that a lot of young, skilled people are not going into education.  The tests show that a disproportionate number are testing at the lowest levels of skills and aptitudes.  That doesn't mean a lot of them won't become good teachers.  We ought to have a society in which both in terms of the environment of teaching being honored as a profession and the pay, is such that the very best, the top of each class, goes into education.  I think last year--as I recall, in Los Angeles--I believe I was told that a beginning teacher there made $13,000 and a beginning policeman $28,000.  I don't begrudge the policeman's salary at all.  But we're saying something about teaching when we give it this low status, and, of course, our kids will pay and our nation will pay.  By now we should know that it is the product of the trained mind that is the greatest source of wealth in America.  It's more important than all of our national resources, everything.  That's from an economic standpoint.  But education, of course--that's why I use the word learning--goes to the basis of our democracy, to our personal enrichment and fulfillment, of our understanding of this ever more dangerous world in which we live.  Education does everything that we need.  And it all begins with what goes on in that classroom.  If it's not effective, if we don't have the best teaching, it's not going to work.  As president, I intend to put a tremendous amount of attention on this.  I've spent a lot of my life in it.

And you heard Governor Hunt; and my supporters will tell you that our state has the first--the highest-ranking job growth in America in the last year. That's true. We could say that we actually have created more private-sector jobs in my state than in the whole rest of the country under the Bush administration, and that's true."

They'll be on that bipartisan commission. And both have agreed to serve because they recognize how urgent and important the task is."

Good, sensible, reasonable, responsible government, giving more power back to the states, back to the governors, back to Governor Steve here starting next year--back to the governors, back to the legislatures."

And I hope and pray, as you all do, that we can conduct our deliberations with a businesslike precision and a dignity befitting our responsibility, and the solemnity of the hour of history in which we meet. For it is a very solemn hour indeed, freighted with the hopes and fears of millions of mankind who see in us, the Democratic Party, sober understanding of the breadth and depth of the revolutionary currents in the world. Here and abroad they see in us awareness that there is no turning back, that, as Justice Holmes said, We must sail sometimes with the wind, sometimes against it; but we must sail and not drift or lie at anchor. They see in us, the Democratic Party that has steered this country through a storm of spears for twenty years, an understanding of a world in the torment of transition from an age that has died to an age struggling to be born. They see in us relentless determination to stand fast against the barbarian at the gate, to cultivate allies with a decent respect for the opinion of others, to patiently explore every misty path to peace and security, which is the only certainty of lower taxes and a better life."

I use me too in the grammatical, not the political sense. Which reminds me that there was a big meeting out here yesterday--a sort of bipartisan gathering with representatives from both branches of the Republican party. I don't know how the peace conference got along but they had a good time criticizing us for everything, as usual. They even accused me of the crime of visiting President Truman the other day--a crime that hasn't been committed since Rutherford B. Hayes, because the party in power has not nominated a candidate who was neither a member of Congress nor the Cabinet in seventy-five years. I thought I detected an explanation of their difficulty in finding something to say, however, when the orator of the day, Senator Nixon, revealed that out at the camp in Colorado, General Eisenhower's vacation headquarters, they ate fried mush most of the time.

There should be no wistful dragging of the feet or turning backward to a dead, irrelevant past.  Government should be competent. Its personnel must not be under the heavy hand of purely political selection or influence. It must not be afraid of raising and spending money for worthy purposes, but it must detest and fear waste and dishonesty as ever present threats to the whole moral basis of government by the consent of the governed because people don't consent voluntarily to be cheated or abused.

It would be a sad thing, indeed, it seems to me, if a great soldier to whom we owe undying affection and gratitude ended up politically between the two Republican parties like that mule I heard about one time that starved to death standing between two stacks of hay, trying to make up his mind which to eat. Now, in a way, I sympathize with his plight; for some time I have been wondering when he was going to find something to say that would not offend one of the Republican parties. Now, at last I think he has found it. In recent days, he has come forth with a fine free-swinging attack on that old punching-bag, corruption."

As a result, we of this generation, who saw farm conditions at their worst in 1932, have had the happy privilege of seeing them over the last decade at their best.

It has been accepted by the best men in both parties. No amount of election year talk can obscure that fact. What the campaign has clearly brought out is that the Old Guard of the Republican party wants to scrap that bipartisan foreign policy--and that their candidate with the new look, the General of the Army, has either forsaken his own great past of becoming the policy partner of Senator Taft and some gentlemen of similarly eccentric views about our world."

We must continue to meet the present urgent needs of the people. Too many Americans today dwell in misery in tenements in our huge congested cities--second-class citizens living in third class houses. Too many Americans still live in rags in sharecroppers' shacks. Too many Americans find that rising living costs are outrunning their pensions, social security benefits, life insurance proceeds and their salaries. The cost of living and wages have been chasing each other up and up in a dizzy, dangerous spiral of inflation that spells disaster for everyone. And we know what to do about that too, if the Republicans will just keep their hands off."

Youngstown was not, in 1932, a pleasant place to work or to live--and Youngstown was typical of most of the cities of America. The steel mills here in the Mahoning Valley were working at 31 percent of capacity. One Youngstown working man out of every three was unemployed. There was no unemployment compensation. The other two men worked at poverty wages. There was no minimum wage law. Those men worked in silence beside the furnaces. There was no collective bargaining act. The foreman's word was law. The working man had no seniority rights in his job and there was almost no collective bargaining contracts; almost no unions. At the end of life's work when you could no longer work, there was nothing. There was no social security. You only knew that one day--and you never knew when--there would be a pink dismissal slip in your envelope, and that would be all. If it was bad at the mill, it was infinitely worse in the street and in the home. Youngstown was one of the first cities to start soup kitchens. So desperate indeed did the city of Youngstown become that the City Council..."

Above all, our Democratic platform calls for action on the overshadowing problems of war and peace--the most important unfinished business of our generation--and I mean steady resistance to Communism and patient and persistent efforts to build a peace which has been man's dearest goal from time immemorial. Now, in these few words--if these were all that you knew about me and about our Democratic platform, well, I will have to confess that you wouldn't know very much for it is easy to get up here on a campaign train and say some nice sounding words, but out of our party you get a lot more than some high sounding words--you get first of all the record of twenty years of solid accomplishment, of accomplishment in the interests of all our people, and I hope you will compare this record with the Republican record before you vote--for, by the way, they have a record too during these past twenty years, and it is easy to sum up that record. Whenever there has been a forward looking, a constructive program to oppose, they have opposed it, and that is about all their record amounts to."

They were merely beautifying the state highway at the access point of the city, where it began to come into the city. And where it had been shabby and ugly and messy they were cleaning it up around there and developing a picnic area--that sort of thing--and an infinite variety of things. Also, of course, from the point of view of the public official, it is a wonderful access point to communities."

I think we must sweep out of the corridors of government, at all levels, national and state, those lingering suspicions which are a holdover from an earlier and very different time.  This is a problem which concerns me very deeply, for I am convinced that both government and business must learn to live together in harmony, before an era of bad temper turns into something infinitely worse. We must avoid at all costs the bitter struggle of class against class, which results inevitably in a drift either to the extreme left or to the extreme right. And you and I know that either kind of drift would end up at the same dreadful destination: a police state with all of the horrors that we have seen in Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia. "

When so many people get up so early in the morning to hear about the great issues on which we will make a decision next Tuesday, we can all feel confident that the future of America rests in responsible hands. It is a sign that every one of you is taking seriously your duty as a citizen; for, in our country it is the people who make all of the final decisions."

It is a record of opposition and harassment for 20 years, not only on price supports, but on all of the other Democratic programs on the storage program, rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, rural electric coops and so on.  The Republican Old Guard has never understood the philosophy behind these programs; it has never understood the programs themselves; it has never understood how they work.  The warning is plain; the Old Guard is hoping that the General can make his easy promises to farmers so convincing that they will forget about their own voting record."

I am down here for one purpose--to help get rid of the administration in Washington, an administration that has been living on emergencies and crises, emergencies that it manufactures. It likes the emergencies because out of them it makes the rugs, and a rug is a handy thing under which to sweep the evidence of your own errors and mistakes. That is what we have been doing with emergencies."

Consequently it felt compelled to take its forces out of that region. We are in that war because, having helped set up the Korean Republic, and knowing that strength was being massed against that republic north of its borders, there was a failure to build up adequate strength in Korea's own defense forces."

It was always the same and usually, ladies and gentlemen, with the shout along the roadsides and in the crowds, Throw 'em out, Ike; give 'em Hell. That is a battle cry that has now been repeated vociferously, in Philadelphia, even more loudly in Minnesota, yesterday in Cleveland, and I assure you I heard it many times coming in from the airport only a couple of hours ago."

In seeking desirable amendments, I will ask the advice and suggestions of all groups--public, management, and labor.  And, gentlemen, I assure you that this invitation of mine will be genuine and in good faith.  It will not be one of those empty theatrical gestures so often made in recent years.  In my own mind I have complete confidence that this job of amending the law can be worked out so that no fair-minded member of your group will consider the results unreasonable.  No such legislation must ever be regarded as final, and in considering amendments to labor legislation, labor will have an equal voice.  It is the American way to take what we have and constantly seek to make it better."

A little sergeant--Sergeant Kuhlen--I will never forget his name as long as I live--came up with an idea.  He found that he could put some knives on the front of our tanks that would go in and cut off these hedges.  The tanks could come through straight and come through shooting, and it wasn't very pleasant for the Germans. "

If we do not stop that kind of thing, ladies and gentlemen, then America cannot be what it has been in the past.  We must have a solvent America, an America that lives within its means, yet so far have they gone with these spendthrift policies that the government itself says that last year every city family had to spend $400 more than that family could earn to pay for its shelter, its food, its clothing and other necessities in the family.  If that goes on, not only is this government going to be broke but all the families in it are going to be broke.  That is not America."

Now, in this crowd, ladies and gentlemen, there are numbers of men who are my old comrades in arms.  Some of them may have fought in the Far Pacific; some may have had duties that kept them in the U.S.; many of them went abroad with me.  And I used to see those fellows along the roads, in the camps, sometimes at reviews, in their barracks, in their kitchen, wherever; and we used to talk about why we were fighting.  And we came to the agreement in simple terms that we were fighting to keep America the kind of land that we believe it to be--a land of freedom and opportunity, not a land dominated by a Hitler or by any group of bureaucrats.  The reason I am in this political campaign, my friends, is in a continuation of that promise.  I am trying to do my part to keep America the kind of country we have always known, which means first of all that you must have a government you can respect and other nations will likewise respect it because you do."

It is in the record as to what the Republican Party expects to do, purposes to do, with price supports, with REA, with cooperatives, with all of those things that mean so much to farm life today.  And that means perishable products as well as nonperishables.  So all of this talk about the Republican Party trying to put the farmer in the poor house is about as weak an argument as they could develop.  They say we want to abolish good times, that everybody will be out with a tin cup on the bread lines.  I made a talk the other night at Peoria where I took to pieces this so-called Democrat prosperity to show that the only advance in living standards the American people have made in the last 20 years was during the five years of World War II.  I do not believe that America wants a prosperity that is based upon the risks and sacrifices that men have to make in uniform against an enemy."

By this I mean the actual cost in dollars is something that you have to add onto all these wasteful and extravagant expenses, as well as the necessary expenses.  But the great damage done to us by corruption in government is, after all, not just the few dollars it takes out of our tax revenues and our pockets.  This mess in Washington lowers our prestige abroad and robs us of pride in our own government.  If we are going to restore pride in government, who is going to do it?  You can't take an organization that has been in power far too long and merely by doing a little face-lifting job, doing a little repaint job, get by with it.  Actually, I believe that the administration candidate said all it needed was a little refreshening.  But as far as I am concerned, how do you refreshen a bad egg?"

I don't come before you, ladies and gentlemen, to make any long list of promises.  All the promises, the political promises, have been used up in the last 20 years anyway.  What I bring to you is a pledge, a pledge couched in the kind of thing that you people have a right to demand and expect of your government, that if you want to send the leaders of this crusade to Washington; they make this pledge now, they will above all things be honest; they will make it possible for all the agencies of the government that have the task of investigating--to make it possible for them to make their findings open to the public.

They will be consulted, and not the way they are consulted now:  You do this or you will get no more.  They will be consulted on what is the problem of their locality.  We have no intention in this crusade of getting a bunch of long-haired Brannan experts to come out and run your farms.  We figure you can do it a little better."

You have fulfilled the vision of those hardy pioneers who set up the early capital of the Texas republic down at the corner of Main Street and Texas Avenue.

Your growth has been phenomenal--the vast industrial development ringing the city; your beautiful churches; your Rice Institute; your University of Houston; your wonderful medical center; and your other institutions of culture and learning.

Then, as if all of this were not enough, why do we have to have any vestige of subversion or dishonesty in our government--in high places and in low? Not long ago, a lady wrote me a letter.  She said, General, I should like to vote for you, but before I do will you promise me this:  That you will see that more of my tax money actually gets to Washington.  I wrote to her and said, My friend, a hard-working American taxpayer does not have to request that common woodshed honesty be observed by American officials in high positions.

It was this: There was quoted a top-secret document of the American Defense Department. How it got there, we will never know probably. But that top-secret document brought out one fact that really answers your question. It was this. There was a military estimate made in September 1947 by military men, and it had this conclusion: The military occupation of South Korea is not essential to the military security of the United States of America."

It was a very, very wonderful promise.  I sincerely appreciated it, but what has happened?  If you are going to educate, you have to start with the record, with the facts.  Who among you here would like the job of defending the record of the government of the past seven years?  Well, I don't have to ask that one again.  Of course, they can't defend that record, a record in which, with all of the assets and resources of this great nation with which we came out of World War II, they have frittered them away--as they have struggled and fumbled and stumbled and fallen in the foreign field.  They have brought us no closer to peace.  We have had these emergencies after emergencies.  We have lost China.

After Woodrow Wilson talked for a few minutes however, with great feeling and great fire of his desire for a unified world and a world of peace, Governor Cox broke in and said, We are behind you 100 percent, and they fought that campaign in part to implement the ideal of Woodrow Wilson for the establishment of the League of Nations, and lost.  But Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt, in losing that election in 1920, held before themselves and the people their concept of the service that they can render in an election, of attempting to turn the attention of the people to the great issues that face us, and the great possibilities that lie in action in the future.  And I believe in this election 40 years later, we merely do not run for office, but we also seek to establish a basic point, that what this country is now doing is not good enough, that in the 1960s, if we are going to maintain our freedom, if we are going to meet our commitments at home and abroad, we have to do better, and that is the basic issue which has separated Mr. Nixon and myself."

There are 15 million American homes, according to the last Bureau of the Census, which are substandard.  Mr. Nixon has issued a paper on housing, and this, I think, is most revealing of all and one of the most endearing qualities of the Vice President.  In his position paper issued in New York within the last three weeks, he says that the Housing Act of 1949 has worked very well, and do you know as a congressman he voted against it?  In that position paper he called for greater emphasis on middle-income housing and he voted against that in 1950.  He calls for a greater flow of housing credit so that the American people can buy houses at low rates of interest.  But he neglects to mention his vote as vice president to increase the interest rates on the GI housing bans.  High interest rates never built a single home and one of the reasons why we are building 200,000 less homes each year than we should to keep up with our population increase is because of the high interest rate policy of this administration."

The point of the matter is that the Republican party and Mr. Nixon in his fourteen years of association with it have not stood for progress, have not stood for breaking new ground, have not stood for breaking new frontiers, and I believe in the 1960s, if the United States is going to fulfill its potential, if we are going to fulfill the destiny which is in store for us in the sixties, if we are going to be the leader of freedom, we are going to have to move here at home.  I come to Philadelphia and ask your help in this campaign.  This election is the means to an end, and the end is a great, stronger, and growing America.

Mr. Nixon has chosen a different road.  He has gone to the American people in the 1960s, in the time of change and revolution, saying, We've never had it so good, saying our prestige in the world has never been higher.  I recall in 1935, when Winston Churchill was warning of the dangers of the Nazi rise, Stanley Baldwin, the leader of the Conservative party, told the people of England that everything was being done in its own good time.

Or we can choose a new day, the new day that I spoke of, where the man that is illiterate can have an education, where the person that is unemployed through no fault of his own can have gainful and productive work, where the mother who is on welfare but who would rather work if she could only leave her babies and her children in a good day care center--we can have a better America."

We walked into beauty parlors and barber shops and restaurants, and on the streets and factory shift lines, later on, shopping centers, farmers' markets, livestock sales barns, city halls, county court houses. We talked a little. And we listened a lot. In New Hampshire and Florida, and Illinois and North Carolina, and all over the country. We had thirty primaries where you could win delegates. And I was in all of them. I didn't win them all. But because my base and my support was from the people, we built up a campaign organization that made history in presidential campaign politics in our country. Long before the convention even met, I had won the nomination of the Democratic party. Most of the delegates who went there for me had never been involved in politics before. But they believed in me and I believed in them, and I haven't changed. And I want to be sure that I've maintained my relationship throughout this present campaign, and up until November 2nd, and particularly after January the 20th. I owe special interest nothing. I owe the people everything and that's the way I'm going to keep it."

Last night was a typical confrontation, I thought, between what we stand for and what the Republicans are. The debate was very revealing. Mr. Ford stood alone. He was making statements about foreign policy, not Mr. Kissinger. What he said outraged our allies, and disturbed our people in this country. There are three hundred thousand Soviet troops in Eastern Europe; there are two divisions in Poland. There are three or four divisions in Czechoslovakia. Eight years after the Soviet Union had promised to remove them. There are fifteen divisions in Eastern Germany. They are now building an even stronger Berlin Wall. If they tear down the wall, which way will the people move? They're not free in Eastern Europe. In Hungary there are three divisions, twenty years after the revolution was snuffed out."

Although we've recently not lived up to ideals, I know of no great nation in history that has more often conducted itself in a moral, unselfish, generous manner abroad, and provided more freedom and opportunity to its own citizens at home. Still, in recent years, we've had reason to be troubled. We've stumbled into the quagmires of Vietnam, and Cambodia, and Chile, and Cyprus, and we've responded inadequately to human suffering that we've recognized in places like Bangladesh, Burundi, and the Sahel area of northern Africa. In other undeveloped and struggling and sometimes starving nations we've allowed virtually unlimited sales of American weapons overseas. As I said in the debate the other night, we've become the arms merchant of the world. This is a policy that's both cynical and dangerous. That we've in effect condoned the efforts of some Arab countries to circumvent the commitment of our Bill of Rights and boycott American businesses who trade with Israel or who have Jewish owners or managers within the businesses themselves.

You pay more on taxes than you do on food, clothing and shelter combined. We need to reverse that course, and we're going to change that course."

And I might say it's disastrous news for American workers and businesses and even worse news for low-and middle-income Americans who have been squeezed and squeezed and squeezed by lower wages and higher taxes in this administration."

Now, actually it doesn't make any difference whether it is Republican or Democratic rascality; a bad public servant is a bad apple and you throw out a bad apple whatever its variety. That is what I believe and I think that is what we are going to do at every level of our government, if the people are conscious enough of what their responsibility is. But rascals in government are only the uglier practices of wasters in government. Economy is just as important as honesty--for a taxpayer's dollar that is wasted is just as bad as a taxpayer's dollar that is stolen. And here again I lay what I hope is not an immodest claim to some hard and educational experience in making both ends of a government budget meet, in keeping a government lean and trimmed down to an efficient size. I have some idea about that; as the product of practical experience in Illinois, I have learned that economy in government isn't just something that you say you are going to have. You have to grind at it all of the time. You have to grind--everybody--up and down the ladder; the purchasing officers who spend millions of the taxpayers' money, the fellows who deal around in government orders, even the girls who want to use a fresh carbon every time they want to write a letter. It is the same old business day and night. You've got to live it yourself twenty-four hours a day."

One is peace and the other is prosperity.  And it is clear, too, that the position of the two parties on these issues is exactly the same as it has been for the last twenty years. The Republicans say that they are for peace and prosperity--but they don't want to do anything about it. The Democrats are for peace and prosperity too, and we have been doing something about it and we are going to go on doing something about it. "

Our programs grow from what we think are people's needs--and I don't mean just a few people--I mean all of the people. And that means equality of opportunity for all, regardless of race and color or creed. Most of all today we stand for peace--not for another war to end all wars, but for peace without war. We are not making the promises that the Republicans are, and we don't play politics with promises we know we cannot keep. We are trying to talk straight to the American people. We are recognizing that the course ahead of us is a stern course; that there are no easy, cheap solutions for Communism, for want, for hunger, for all of the miseries that torment our world. But we believe with all of our hearts that if we make this nation strong we can keep good times at home and avoid that war that would destroy the world. "

It has been common knowledge, I thought, for a long time that the United States has been training and equipping Korean forces and that these forces are taking on more and more of the burden. I pointed this out some weeks ago and it has been frequently reported in the press over the past three years."

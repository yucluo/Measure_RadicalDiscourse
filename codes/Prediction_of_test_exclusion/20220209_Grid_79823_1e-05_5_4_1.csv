But I still don't feel that I am wasting my time by coming out here, and I am very grateful to all of you for being here, and to all of these children. I hope you are not cutting school."
8.59084813921046e-05,0.999914091518608,1023_2,0,"My heart is very much in these programs because whenever you travel through this great land of ours, you can't help but see how much these programs have meant to so many people. Above all, our Democratic platform calls for action on the overshadowing problems of war and peace--the most important unfinished business of our generation--and I mean steady resistance to Communism and patient and persistent efforts to build a peace which has been man's dearest goal from time immemorial. Now, in these few words--if these were all that you knew about me and about our Democratic platform, well, I will have to confess that you wouldn't know very much for it is easy to get up here on a campaign train and say some nice sounding words, but out of our party you get a lot more than some high sounding words--you get first of all the record of twenty years of solid accomplishment, of accomplishment in the interests of all our people, and I hope you will compare this record with the Republican record before you vote--for, by the way, they have a record too during these past twenty years, and it is easy to sum up that record. Whenever there has been a forward looking, a constructive program to oppose, they have opposed it, and that is about all their record amounts to."

And somewhere in this process America has fundamentally changed--a new view, a new compassion, a new faith has emerged. In a way it is a moral revival, and it has altered the tone and the meaning of our life. And how different a prospect faces a young man or a young woman of today from what faced the youth of my generation. The only or, most of all, the go-getter was the hero. Few cared about politics or public service -almost none who went through school or college with me took any positive interest in that, or have subsequently. Few had the sense of civil or social responsibility that we find today, when they were young."
8.82262417728104e-05,0.999911773758227,1033_17,0,"But if we deal with this problem foolishly, we risk atomic war, on the one hand, or ignominious surrender, on the other--in either case, the destruction of freedom and civilization. I ask you: to whom should our people entrust the fight against Communism--to those Old Guard Republicans who, on one issue after another, vote the way our enemies like to see them vote? Or to those who have rallied the free world against Communist aggression?"
8.88353022423249e-05,0.999911164697758,1037_2,0,"Now, you know, I wouldn't say, my friends, that this proves conclusively that the Old Guard Republicans are really Communists, but I suppose if I were an Old Guard Republican I would, because that is exactly the way they argue. The great transformation which has overtaken our country in these twenty years has come about, in great part, because we have had a new spirit and a new purpose in our government--you could almost feel the change from confusion to confidence, from fear to faith, when the election of 1932 produced a great new leader, Franklin Roosevelt. And that was only the beginning of the process by which America began to lift itself out of the depths, both economically and spiritually, and onto a new plane of social responsibility and of decency. Government assumed responsibilities to avert economic catastrophe and to assure reasonable levels of security for the people. By doing this, great new energies within the people were unlocked. Of course, this new activity on the part of government aroused resentment. The Old Guard began raising their tired old refrain of socialism, and regimentation; you have heard these cries against every new idea in American history since the post office and the public schools."
9.46661428506428e-05,0.999905333857149,1039_3,0,"Mr. Chairman, I just happened to run across one thing that a group was doing in some town in Illinois which is illustrative of what I mean by the variety of possibilities. They were merely beautifying the state highway at the access point of the city, where it began to come into the city. And where it had been shabby and ugly and messy they were cleaning it up around there and developing a picnic area--that sort of thing--and an infinite variety of things. Also, of course, from the point of view of the public official, it is a wonderful access point to communities."

We can win peace in the world without a third world war, but only by dedicating our minds and our hearts, our sweat and our blood to that great task for as long as may be necessary. I tell you that the way to our goal is not easy, but the goal is worth the price, for the goal is nothing less than a nation fair and productive beyond our dreams and a world of law and order where men of good will can live together in equal dignity and under God. This is the future that we seek and this is the future for which I know we are willing to work and to sacrifice and to labor with all of our minds and with all of our hearts, and this is the cause to which we call you. We don't call it a crusade--we just call it, Forward with America."
8.80557456038391e-05,0.999911944254396,1054_5,0,"I think, regardless of political considerations, that it is essential that if we are going to win in the long term this conflict with Communists--this conflict with a society that seeks to spread itself over the entire globe--that we must recognize that until we find the means--and until we find cooperation in the means of restoring a sense of well-being to peoples who know little of freedom in the terms that we understand it, that we will have a very threatening and a hostile enemy. That is why one can believe that the importance of bolstering our defenses by the foreign aid programs--Point Four, and things of that kind--are essential if we are going to hope to frustrate the designs of this godless tyranny throughout the world. I thank you so much for affording me this opportunity of participating even briefly in the ceremonies. I count you very fortunate indeed to have this splendid housing development in your neighborhood; and I can add that I am very jealous of it. I should like to be participating in a similar project in Chicago where we too have desperate need of the advantages of public housing."
8.21751298471647e-05,0.999917824870153,1068_1,0,"I am most grateful to all of you for coming out here at this inconvenient hour and I appreciate your courtesy, and I am sure that your presence here is a good omen both for the Democratic party and for our country. When so many people get up so early in the morning to hear about the great issues on which we will make a decision next Tuesday, we can all feel confident that the future of America rests in responsible hands. It is a sign that every one of you is taking seriously your duty as a citizen; for, in our country it is the people who make all of the final decisions."
8.46504140112155e-05,0.999915349585989,1084_9,0,"I think you know and I know that they have never really been ahead at any time. They just throw so much confetti at each other, read so many of each other's editorials, and cheer each other's speeches so loudly, that they begin to think that everyone agrees with them. Well, they don't. And I think you can rely on the American people every time to tell who is really talking sense and who isn't. "
9.75363383422508e-05,0.999902463661658,1085_15,0,"No, I've seen and heard the deep-throated courage and confidence and faith of strong men and women and happy children--people who still believe in one another, in spite of all the timid, doubting men. And I thank them every one for the reception they have given me--for their infinite courtesy and their heartening friendliness.  I have asked you for your support for my candidacy. I ask you now for support of our common faith in this country. The confidence we've inherited is our greatest wealth, the source of our strength. "
0.000103859014787008,0.999896140985213,1095_6,0,"The next thing we must do is remember this:  There are many group tasks that must be done by us in our families, in our communities, in our states, and finally in the nation.  Lately it seems to be too much in the nation.  We do these things together because no one can do them for himself alone.  We must approach those group problems with a spirit of cooperation, a readiness to accept the responsibilities of each of us which are group in character.  If we do not do that then there comes that creeping tide of central law that finally results in the all-powerful state, and we do it because we are regimented.  Let us do our jobs at home, first in the family, then in the village, then in the state.  Let's not let the central government get any more of them than we have to."

My convictions would require it.   The federal government did not create the states in this republic.  The states created the federal government.  The creation should not supersede the creator."

A little sergeant--Sergeant Kuhlen--I will never forget his name as long as I live--came up with an idea.  He found that he could put some knives on the front of our tanks that would go in and cut off these hedges.  The tanks could come through straight and come through shooting, and it wasn't very pleasant for the Germans. "
8.20001384559681e-05,0.999917999861544,1156_41,0,"It is true, of course, that the American taxpayer is burdened heavily by Soviet threat.  But what the Democratic nominee confessed was that under the present administration policy the American taxpayer is dancing to the Soviet tune and not getting for his tax dollar a clear, coherent plan to do away with the menace of war.  The telltale wording of that statement reflects the surrender of initiative to the Communists."
8.77096769415194e-05,0.999912290323058,1165_4,0,"Now, the government has stumbled and fumbled in failing to bring us closer to peace.  In the last seven years look what has happened to us.  We stopped the shooting war in 1945 the strongest military nation in the world, to say nothing of our academic strength and our spiritual, intellectual, scientific and moral strength.  We were the greatest military nation on the globe."
8.65981066689834e-05,0.999913401893332,1174_9,0,"Can this burden be lightened without endangering national security? A Democrat administration--stale and self-satisfied from being too long in power complacently says: No, nothing can be done. That is not an American answer. Our answer is: Yes, much can be done."
8.86268581048844e-05,0.999911373141895,1175_1,0,"Now it happens today is September 25th.  It is one of the significant days in our history that is not often celebrated.  It is the day that marked the adoption of the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution.  In that Bill of Rights it specifies what are the rights of human beings as opposed to the power of government, the limits of what government can do to the individual today, and those ten amendments, possibly coupled with the organization our forefathers gave us, is the real genius of American government.  When those rights, any one of them, comes in peril from within or any threat from without, it is time for every loyal American, not just the rich, not just the farmers, not just the workmen, but everybody.  It is time for every loyal American to rise up, take a look, gird himself for battle, and fight off the encroachment."
8.79232581424112e-05,0.999912076741858,1197_13,0,"In Omaha the statements made in the Kasson speech in Minnesota were extended.  It is in the record as to what the Republican Party expects to do, purposes to do, with price supports, with REA, with cooperatives, with all of those things that mean so much to farm life today.  And that means perishable products as well as nonperishables.  So all of this talk about the Republican Party trying to put the farmer in the poor house is about as weak an argument as they could develop.  They say we want to abolish good times, that everybody will be out with a tin cup on the bread lines.  I made a talk the other night at Peoria where I took to pieces this so-called Democrat prosperity to show that the only advance in living standards the American people have made in the last 20 years was during the five years of World War II.  I do not believe that America wants a prosperity that is based upon the risks and sacrifices that men have to make in uniform against an enemy."
8.2737804881675e-05,0.999917262195119,1207_1,0,"You know, this thing seems to me to be particularly significant:  this evening there will be 6,000 more Americans than there were last evening.  Those Americans, of course, are largely our new babies born.  When each baby is born today it gets a very extraordinary present as it arrives into this world:  it gets its share of the national debt; it owes $1,750 for the privilege of having been born."
9.06833283745612e-05,0.999909316671625,1213_8,0,"If we do that, ladies and gentlemen, then we are a truly religious civilization, marching forward under a firm leadership, a united leadership that is bound to bring us, first, peace in the world, greater prosperity at home, with that kind of distribution of that prosperity that allows every single loyal American of good will to work for the betterment of himself, his family, his community and America. I don't come before you, ladies and gentlemen, to make any long list of promises.  All the promises, the political promises, have been used up in the last 20 years anyway.  What I bring to you is a pledge, a pledge couched in the kind of thing that you people have a right to demand and expect of your government, that if you want to send the leaders of this crusade to Washington; they make this pledge now, they will above all things be honest; they will make it possible for all the agencies of the government that have the task of investigating--to make it possible for them to make their findings open to the public.  There will be no concealing of crookedness and dirt in the new administration."

8.59343315683103e-05,0.999914065668432,1246_8,0,"All of these costs and all of these expenditures would be bad enough if they were limited strictly to what they have to be, but when we have waste and carelessness piled on top of that, to the point where we are getting two airfields for the price of five, we simply cannot afford that luxury in this time of our history. Then, as if all of this were not enough, why do we have to have any vestige of subversion or dishonesty in our government--in high places and in low? Not long ago, a lady wrote me a letter.  She said, General, I should like to vote for you, but before I do will you promise me this:  That you will see that more of my tax money actually gets to Washington.  I wrote to her and said, My friend, a hard-working American taxpayer does not have to request that common woodshed honesty be observed by American officials in high positions.  That we can and should demand, and we don't have to ask for it."
9.89176279841847e-05,0.999901082372016,1269_21,0,"A strong America, a well-governed America, an America that is morally and spiritually sound, is the best answer to the evil threat of cynicism and lack of self-respect within, and to the evil threat of Communism without.  If you believe that as I do, will you join our crusade? This crusade which I have taken to the American people represents what I, myself, believe.  I have acted and I have spoken from my own deep inner convictions of what is best and right for America.  I have been steadfast to my convictions.  I have made no deals.  I am still a no deal man.  And let me tell you just this:  I have lived sixty-two years and one week and I have never been anyone's captive yet.  And never will be!"
8.54351359494053e-05,0.99991456486405,1270_16,0,"Then, we must get our own administrative house in order to handle better our part of the task of economic cooperation.  Today, the White House, the State Department, the International Trade Section of the Department of Commerce, the Treasury Department, the Mutual Security Administration, the Point IV planners, the Pentagon, and the international business enterprises go their several, uncoordinated, though well-meaning ways.  Without impinging upon the rights and responsibilities of private enterprise, including private investors, we must coordinate and mobilize mutually-beneficial economic cooperation, as effectively as we mobilize for military defense."
8.26975764844137e-05,0.999917302423515,1280_3,0,"We have got to get dedicated men and women from all over this United States who have been living closer to the people, who have not grown arrogant by being too long in power, who have not gotten too complacent or indifferent or think they can sell any bill of goods of fear and despair to America and so secure its votes. Now, if we are going to have a fresh start on this thing, we have got to have a complete change in the political complexion in Washington.  I picked up this morning a little clipping.  I am going to read to you just two sentences:  In South Bend, Indiana, yesterday, someone from the crowd addressed by the Democratic candidate, the administration's hand-picked candidate, shouted this question, Would you fire Acheson?   And it says here, Dean Acheson, the Secretary of State, and the answer was this, I will answer questions like that after the election, the Governor replied.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is the only answer the poor man could make.  He has the record, this sorry record of the last seven years to defend, and here is one he can't defend; but he can't on the other hand, say in advance, I repudiate that record and the people who have made it.  But I say, this crusade in which I am engaged does repudiate that record of error, and we are ready to replace from top to bottom.  No one has anything but admiration for the great body of public servants of America who are contained in the civil service and in the uniformed services.  We are talking, in this top to bottom clean-out, about these political appointees, the policy-makers, if you please, of our country--and not only in domestic policy but in this foreign field."

You have furnished a large share of the manpower and brain power which have made our farms and factories the most productive in the world.  Your people have been in the vanguard of the evolution in this country of an enlightened labor policy.  You have fought to defend America and the principles for which she stands."

No agency, public or private, has been more effective in arousing the hearts and minds of the plain people of the Free World to an awareness of the menace. By its leadership in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, American labor has welded the free trade unions of every nation into a solid front against Communism."

I can't help remembering that when I said fellow veterans to you at this convention four years ago I did so with a considerable degree of self-consciousness. My brief service as an Apprentice Seaman in 1918 hardly seemed like a sufficient claim to veteran status."

But more important even than that, perhaps, is the shunting aside of men who are experienced and trained in a lifetime of conservation work, in favor of politician appointees. The agency that looked at tomorrow's needs for minerals has been disbanded--and nothing put in its place. The Soil Conservation Service has been weakened--and must be revived. We need the leadership that will look at the nation's needs for water, for areas of recreation in the great open country, for land, and forest, and streams. We need, in other words really to look together at the needs and resources of our common future."

First of all, we must rededicate ourselves to our faith in democracy and make that faith a living principle. In the Middle East, Israel is a beacon of democratic faith and of twentieth century progress. Our policy, therefore, should be founded on the firm cornerstone of the friendship of the American people for its democratic friend--Israel. For three years we have tried the ignoble, expedient policy of isolating Israel and trying to buy the friendship of dictators. Colonel Nasser has given us his answer. Appeasement has once again proved neither wise nor honorable nor expedient."

And only last Sunday--just four years ago--Mr. Dulles said in a television interview that the United States, Britain, and France have developed a common policy, and I think it's amazing the degree to which we have had a common policy... and the fact that there are certain minor superficial difficulties as to details about just how you handle tolls, or how much is going to get paid to Egypt and how much isn't, doesn't detract from the fact that we have a common policy.

In those lands, the fruits of imperialism are discontent, unrest, riots in one place and demonstrations in another, until the tyranny exercised over them either dissolves or is expelled. The day of liberation may be postponed where armed forces for a time make protest suicidal. But all history testifies that the memory of freedom is not erased by the fear of guns, and the love of freedom is more enduring than the power of tyrants. But it is necessary that the inspiration of freedom, and the benefits enjoyed by those who possess it, are known to those oppressed."

Well, you know, that's like the old medicine man who used to come to town--the same remedy for everything--spend more money--and that's your money. Now, the difference was, you know, that the medicine man had the same remedy--different labels on the bottle--it would cure snakebite or rheumatism or anything else, but it really didn't do it; and the difference was the medicine man always got out of town just before the people caught up with the fact that the remedy didn't work.

Sometimes, it is when people decide that others should not have the right to be heard.  Sometimes it is when people decide that they will so conduct themselves as to cause disarray in public gathering.  Censorship is evil in any of its forms.  Those who would first destroy the meaning of democracy are those who first seek to destroy the functioning of the democratic process.

He felt very weak, he said, and his legs were rubbery before the fight.  But he was determined to win.  He knew he had the qualities of a champion--and those qualities are great courage, great perseverance--and he went into that ring, and I think some of you may have seen him on television.  I saw a replay of some of it last night, and he went on out there and he won.  And he has told one of my associates that he was basically a religious man, that every time he went to his corner during the fight he asked God Almighty to give him strength to go out there, and he said he was given that strength.

These are some of the urgent questions we all must answer--first as citizens, then as leaders of government. For at every level of government--local, state, and federal--elected and appointed officials have the duty to listen before they have the right to lead. They do not own the public schools.

May I salute our longstanding friends, George and Janet Voinovich, and say you are very lucky in this state to have this man as your governor. Also I want to single out another one, and that's Chalmers Wylie. He and I went to Congress on the same day, and he served Columbus with great distinction.

All these polls that are all over the field that these people live and die by, we don't have to read those anymore. But when you enter that voting booth, you have to ask yourself three commonsense questions: Who has the right vision? And I've touched on the positive answers of that today. Who has the right vision for our economic future? Who can lead us through what is a global transition? Which candidate has the character?

And our formula is simple: We have to meet our challenges, we have to protect our values--opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and a community in which every single person who works hard and plays by the rules no matter whatever else you want to say about them has got a role to play, a place at the table and we'll be walking across that bridge to the twenty-first century together.

Our plan is pretty simple. First of all, we say do no harm. Continue to resist the efforts of the other party to make it harder to get student loans and to raise the cost of the student loans. We want to keep the direct loan program. I pledged to you four years ago when I came here, if you voted for me I would pass a student loan program that would reduce the cost of student loans and let people pay it back as a percentage of their income, so no matter how much they had to borrow they would always be able to afford to go to college.

Let me say when I got off the airplane today at the International Guard Terminal in Chicago, I was met by the Colonel there, who said, it's a really wonderful school that you're going to visit. And he said, I want you to have this flag pin and these bubble gum cards that those kids made for children in Bosnia. I want you to know what kind of a special place H-F is.

We're going to say to Americans, if you want to go to community college for two years, all you have to do is work hard, make your grades.

We should expand the Family and Medical Leave Act to give parents a little time off to take their children to the doctor and to parent-teacher conferences.

We have to continue to invest in research to build a better future. I want the young people here to be able to do those jobs of the future.

I want us to be a country that is coming together, respecting our diversity and clinging to our shared values instead of being torn apart by our differences, as so many countries all around the world are. Now, who would have thought fifteen or twenty years ago at the height of the Cold War we could ever see the threat of communism fade from the world, that we would see the ugly rise of old racial and ethnic and religious hatreds consuming people all around the globe.

Under our plan, we'll create a GI Bill for America's workers.

He stood for the things I think are right. He stood for them in the way that was right. I think of him particularly today because he retained--as mayor, governor, attorney general and supreme court justice--the humility which is all too rare a quality among democracy's leaders. He never, even from the heights of public service he reached, looked down on people. He always looked up to them. Recalling what Frank Murphy stood for is about the best advice a candidate for the presidency could give himself on Labor Day of this election year."

You remember how the two Republican parties pulled out their six-guns and went after each other in Chicago. Well, there is still today the same divided, confused, quarreling bunch we all saw on the TV screen when they had their scrimmage out there in the stockyards at Chicago."

As a result, we of this generation, who saw farm conditions at their worst in 1932, have had the happy privilege of seeing them over the last decade at their best. I am proud of the work my party has done in these twenty years to restore the American farmer to a position of equality and dignity in our national life."

By retraining men who are replaced by machines and directing them to new jobs, where now we simply pay them unemployment compensation, we could save both manpower and tax money. 4.

The issue then was whether the government would help make water available for small farmers who wanted to settle on new land. Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican president, put through that law, and we honor him for it. But as Theodore Roosevelt himself noted in his autobiography, he put the law through over the bitter opposition of the Old Guard Republicans in Congress. He observed that they consistently vote for local and private interests and against the interest of the people as a whole. And note, too that the original Reclamation Law was sponsored in the House of Representatives by Representative Newlands of Nevada, a Democrat. It passed by the votes of 77 Democrats and 69 Republicans."

We must continue to meet the present urgent needs of the people. Too many Americans today dwell in misery in tenements in our huge congested cities--second-class citizens living in third class houses. Too many Americans still live in rags in sharecroppers' shacks. Too many Americans find that rising living costs are outrunning their pensions, social security benefits, life insurance proceeds and their salaries. The cost of living and wages have been chasing each other up and up in a dizzy, dangerous spiral of inflation that spells disaster for everyone. And we know what to do about that too, if the Republicans will just keep their hands off."

He wants you to believe the Republican party will make good on it. Well, the Republicans made the same pledge--the same promise--in their 1944 platform. But what happened? Two years later they gained control of the Eightieth Congress. They had a chance to make good on their promise. Did they make good? They not only did not fulfill that pledge--they actually took social security coverage away from more than a half million people."

Youngstown was not, in 1932, a pleasant place to work or to live--and Youngstown was typical of most of the cities of America. The steel mills here in the Mahoning Valley were working at 31 percent of capacity. One Youngstown working man out of every three was unemployed. There was no unemployment compensation. The other two men worked at poverty wages. There was no minimum wage law. Those men worked in silence beside the furnaces. There was no collective bargaining act. The foreman's word was law. The working man had no seniority rights in his job and there was almost no collective bargaining contracts; almost no unions. At the end of life's work when you could no longer work, there was nothing. There was no social security. You only knew that one day--and you never knew when--there would be a pink dismissal slip in your envelope, and that would be all. If it was bad at the mill, it was infinitely worse in the street and in the home. Youngstown was one of the first cities to start soup kitchens. So desperate indeed did the city of Youngstown become that the City Council..."

I want to say to you that one of the happiest experiences that I have had in my brief life as a politician has been today in New York state. Not the least of it has been the fact that I have been privileged to travel with one of the most beloved and respected citizens of our generation, your Senator Herbert Lehman of New York."

In fighting Communists at home, I shall rely on such experienced guardians of our security as J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and General Bedell Smith of the Central Intelligence Agency. These men fight Communism as it must be fought--with care, thoroughness, precision--and silence."

They were merely beautifying the state highway at the access point of the city, where it began to come into the city. And where it had been shabby and ugly and messy they were cleaning it up around there and developing a picnic area--that sort of thing--and an infinite variety of things. Also, of course, from the point of view of the public official, it is a wonderful access point to communities."

We are for the dynamic system of enterprise which has grown out of the great partnership of public and private initiative in this country.  We are against socialism--creeping, crawling, loping, galloping, or even the make-believe kind that takes up so much space in the Republican oratory these days."

It is a record of opposition and harassment for 20 years, not only on price supports, but on all of the other Democratic programs on the storage program, rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, rural electric coops and so on.  The Republican Old Guard has never understood the philosophy behind these programs; it has never understood the programs themselves; it has never understood how they work.  The warning is plain; the Old Guard is hoping that the General can make his easy promises to farmers so convincing that they will forget about their own voting record."

They just throw so much confetti at each other, read so many of each other's editorials, and cheer each other's speeches so loudly, that they begin to think that everyone agrees with them. Well, they don't. And I think you can rely on the American people every time to tell who is really talking sense and who isn't. "

In those days, war traveled no faster than a horse's jog.  I ended my last tour with troops in May of this year.  By then, the pace of war had stepped up to the speed of the jet plane and the impact of the atomic bomb."

Consequently it felt compelled to take its forces out of that region. We are in that war because, having helped set up the Korean Republic, and knowing that strength was being massed against that republic north of its borders, there was a failure to build up adequate strength in Korea's own defense forces."

It was always the same and usually, ladies and gentlemen, with the shout along the roadsides and in the crowds, Throw 'em out, Ike; give 'em Hell. That is a battle cry that has now been repeated vociferously, in Philadelphia, even more loudly in Minnesota, yesterday in Cleveland, and I assure you I heard it many times coming in from the airport only a couple of hours ago."

If we do not stop that kind of thing, ladies and gentlemen, then America cannot be what it has been in the past.  We must have a solvent America, an America that lives within its means, yet so far have they gone with these spendthrift policies that the government itself says that last year every city family had to spend $400 more than that family could earn to pay for its shelter, its food, its clothing and other necessities in the family.  If that goes on, not only is this government going to be broke but all the families in it are going to be broke.  That is not America."

But then I think of you people who work not only on an intensive basis like that part of the time, but all the time, keeping the party together, keeping it financed, keeping it presented properly before all the people, and I realize what public service really means.  It is not just the limelight, although sometimes these lights are pretty bright, at that.  It is the day by day chore."

You know, folks, it strikes me that Senator Dirksen must indeed be a very powerful Senator when he can arrange by remote control such weather for this meeting.  I pay my compliments to him.  To each of you I extend my very warm thanks for coming here this afternoon, for giving me a chance to greet you, to say hello, and to express to you one or two thoughts that I have in mind as we progress in this political campaign."

There can be no peace in this world until there is a strong America leading us toward peace--strong spiritually, economically, financially, and finally militarily. We are going to have that kind of strength only if we are united behind a government that excites our pride.  Such a government will have great prestige abroad; the free countries will want to join with us in establishing a collective security."

By this I mean the actual cost in dollars is something that you have to add onto all these wasteful and extravagant expenses, as well as the necessary expenses.  But the great damage done to us by corruption in government is, after all, not just the few dollars it takes out of our tax revenues and our pockets.  This mess in Washington lowers our prestige abroad and robs us of pride in our own government.  If we are going to restore pride in government, who is going to do it?  You can't take an organization that has been in power far too long and merely by doing a little face-lifting job, doing a little repaint job, get by with it.  Actually, I believe that the administration candidate said all it needed was a little refreshening.  But as far as I am concerned, how do you refreshen a bad egg?"

We will do them ladies and gentlemen only if we are a united people, united behind the great aspirations and purposes of our government.  And right there is the crux of the matter.  You must have a government that you trust, respect and believe in, if you are going to have a united United States.  A united United States would be a strong bulwark of peace.  A united strong United States can lead the free nations of the world into that kind of collective security program that will lift a great burden from our hearts:  the burden of fear abroad."

You give me a chance to look in your faces, to bring you a word of greeting, and to give you one or two of the thoughts that are on my mind as we go through this political campaign.  I have had a wonderful day and a half in your state, starting up at Sacramento.  It seems to me I have been covering ground very rapidly and every place there seems to be a new surprise.  Now, for example, here when the so-called professional politicians began to give me my lessons in this new art a few months back, they told me there was one thing you could not do-go to an airport and address a group of American citizens.  I was told they simply wouldn't come.  So I find out today that at least in Long Beach those political friends of mine were wrong, and I am delighted."

You have fulfilled the vision of those hardy pioneers who set up the early capital of the Texas republic down at the corner of Main Street and Texas Avenue.  You have vindicated their resolute belief in the unlimited future of this region.  Your growth has been phenomenal--the vast industrial development ringing the city; your beautiful churches; your Rice Institute; your University of Houston; your wonderful medical center; and your other institutions of culture and learning.

Today, the White House, the State Department, the International Trade Section of the Department of Commerce, the Treasury Department, the Mutual Security Administration, the Point IV planners, the Pentagon, and the international business enterprises go their several, uncoordinated, though well-meaning ways.  Without impinging upon the rights and responsibilities of private enterprise, including private investors, we must coordinate and mobilize mutually-beneficial economic cooperation, as effectively as we mobilize for military defense."

Second, by skillful, aggressive, and ruthless prosecution of the Cold War, the Soviet Empire has added to its already great resources the important industrial complex of Central and Eastern Europe, and has added to its own large population six-hundred million human beings for use either as slave labor, or as expendable military masses."

Now, if we are going to have a fresh start on this thing, we have got to have a complete change in the political complexion in Washington.  I picked up this morning a little clipping.  I am going to read to you just two sentences:  In South Bend, Indiana, yesterday, someone from the crowd addressed by the Democratic candidate, the administration's hand-picked candidate, shouted this question, Would you fire Acheson?   And it says here, Dean Acheson, the Secretary of State, and the answer was this, I will answer questions like that after the election, the Governor replied.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is the only answer the poor man could make.  He has the record, this sorry record of the last seven years to defend, and here is one he can't defend; but he can't on the other hand, say in advance, I repudiate that record and the people who have made it.  But I say, this crusade in which I am engaged does repudiate that record of error, and we are ready to replace from top to bottom.  No one has anything but admiration for the great body of public servants of America who are contained in the civil service and in the uniformed services.  We are talking, in this top to bottom clean-out, about these political appointees, the policy-makers, if you please, of our country--and not only in domestic policy but in this foreign field."
0.000131279860424397,0.999868720139576,1290_14,0,"Now, ladies and gentlemen, in concluding this short statement, I want to say this:  I do not come before you to engage in any competition of political promises.  This party in power in the last seven years has used up every possible political promise there is, and some of them have gotten pretty shopworn.  For example, there is no easier way to duck an issue than to say this, I will promise you a law, well knowing they cannot deliver it.  There is no easier way to get out of a situation.  What I promise you is work, never ending work, to make certain that justice is done.  So I cannot come before you with the competition of promises, but I do come before you with a pledge, and this is the pledge.  If you want to put this crusade at the helm of your government; if you want to substitute for these 22 caliber men who are trying to hold 45 caliber jobs the finest men and women that we can draw from all sections of this country, from every walk of life--and let me say plainly, based upon merit and without respect to color or creed; if you want to have a government of that kind, then you belong in this crusade."

It was this: There was quoted a top-secret document of the American Defense Department. How it got there, we will never know probably. But that top-secret document brought out one fact that really answers your question. It was this. There was a military estimate made in September 1947 by military men, and it had this conclusion: The military occupation of South Korea is not essential to the military security of the United States of America."

But it happens that we have been the ones who are preaching that the greater fear and the threat of our time is Communism, and the only way to fight Communism is with a prosperous America--an America that is fully employed, with working men and women at good jobs with good pay, with farmers prosperous.  We preached that and taught it and carried it everywhere.  So they had to abandon that."

I hated everybody who hadn't been born ten generations back in the United States, and they thought I didn't know any American Indians, so this looked like a pretty good one.  They said I was anti-Catholic, anti-Negro, anti-Semitic, anti-everything.  Well, that one I didn't have to answer, my friends.  I am very proud of the fine friends of all those groups who jumped into the public print and into the headlines and said, That is just a plain lie, because we know he is not."

We could make some allowance for them if they had the honesty or the common sense, or both, to admit that they had been deceived and to show a stern purpose of preventing similar subversion in the future. There has been considerable concern--and rightfully so--about methods to be used in rooting Communism out of our government."

No agency, public or private, has been more effective in arousing the hearts and minds of the plain people of the Free World to an awareness of the menace. By its leadership in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, American labor has welded the free trade unions of every nation into a solid front against Communism."

Every time that we fail to meet our problems, every time that we fail to move our economy forward, we fail not only our own people, but we fail all those who look to us for leadership.  My judgment is that there is a very clear choice between the Republican and the Democratic parties.  They stand for different things, and they have stood for different things all through this century.  Woodrow Wilson, running in 1912, said that the Republican party idea of policy is to sit on the lid.  Franklin Roosevelt carried the fight in 1932 and 1936 and Harry Truman carried the fight in 1948, and on the issues which matter, housing, social security, medical care for the aged, minimum wage, development of the resources of this country, I believe the Democratic party looks forward.  I believe it has presented to this country programs which move the economy of this country."

But instead of holding out a helping hand of friendship to the desperate people of Cuba, nearly all our aid was in the form of weapons assistance--assistance which merely strengthened the Batista dictatorship--assistance which completely failed to advance the economic welfare of the Cuban people--assistance which enabled Castro and the Communists to encourage the growing belief that America was indifferent to Cuban aspirations for a decent life."

And--at the same foreign ministers' conference--the United States suffered one of its few diplomatic defeats in the history of inter-American relations, when it was forced to withdraw its protest over Communist efforts in this hemisphere. This is a critical situation--to find so dangerous an enemy on our very doorstep.  The American people want to know how this was permitted to happen--how the Iron Curtain could have advanced almost to our front yard.  They want to know the truth--and I believe that they are entitled to the truth.  It is not enough to blame it on unknown state department personnel.  Major policy on issues such as Cuban security is made at the highest levels--in the national Security Council and elsewhere--and it is the party in power which must accept full responsibility for this disaster."

Roosevelt, who was running in 1920 for the vice presidency of the United States, with Governor Cox of Ohio.  Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt then journeyed to Washington, D.C., and went to see Woodrow Wilson, sick, aging, and at the end of his career.  After Woodrow Wilson talked for a few minutes however, with great feeling and great fire of his desire for a unified world and a world of peace, Governor Cox broke in and said, We are behind you 100 percent, and they fought that campaign in part to implement the ideal of Woodrow Wilson for the establishment of the League of Nations, and lost.  But Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt, in losing that election in 1920, held before themselves and the people their concept of the service that they can render in an election, of attempting to turn the attention of the people to the great issues that face us, and the great possibilities that lie in action in the future.  And I believe in this election 40 years later, we merely do not run for office, but we also seek to establish a basic point, that what this country is now doing is not good enough, that in the 1960s, if we are going to maintain our freedom, if we are going to meet our commitments at home and abroad, we have to do better, and that is the basic issue which has separated Mr. Nixon and myself."

The point of the matter is that the Republican party and Mr. Nixon in his fourteen years of association with it have not stood for progress, have not stood for breaking new ground, have not stood for breaking new frontiers, and I believe in the 1960s, if the United States is going to fulfill its potential, if we are going to fulfill the destiny which is in store for us in the sixties, if we are going to be the leader of freedom, we are going to have to move here at home.  I come to Philadelphia and ask your help in this campaign.  This election is the means to an end, and the end is a great, stronger, and growing America.

Mr. Nixon may tell us to forget the Republican party, he may tell us that he speaks for all the people, but I don't think the people of this state of New Mexico and the people of the United States are going to forget the record of the Republican party which he so well represents.

In my judgment they are two: first, there is the point of view expressed by the Vice President that this country has never been stronger, that our security is assured, that we are experiencing and enjoying unprecedented prosperity from one end of the country to the other, and that the way to win the peace is by journeys through Eastern Europe in order to inform them of the value of freedom.  I want to make it clear that Mr. Nixon may decide, if he is elected, to go to Eastern Europe, but I am going to Washington, D.C., because that is the place.

Why do I set that particular standard?

At the outset I would like this point clearly understood: the problems of farm people ought not be approached, as far too often has been the case in the past, as something to exploit for political advantage.

I could tell you that the way to get it is just to leave it to Washington, that Washington is going to provide the jobs and the schools and the progress we need, but that isn't the way it work in this country of ours.

The thing that ran through my mind I'm sure was what would run through your mind--that the most important question and the most important responsibility for the next president of the United States is to see that those boys and thousands like them are always in uniforms of peace and never have to be in uniforms of war. And so I say to you today that the most important responsibility of the next president is to keep the peace without surrender and that is the question you should ask--which of the candidates--which of the two for president and vice president will best provide that leadership.

And that's the way to get it, and not through just sending it down to Washington to create the jobs through what Washington spends. There was another point that I would make.  I make it here recognizing that most of the people in this great audience are those that have had rare opportunities.  You have had the chance to go up in your communities, to go to school.

Now, that doesn't mean that we won't always go the extra mile--and Cabot Lodge and I have some ideas for strengthening the United Nations, for setting up new organizations which can strengthen the cause of peace and freedom throughout the world. But, my friends, I can assure you of this: we are not, under any circumstances, going to enter into any agreements with the Soviet leaders which would surrender freedom any place in the world, because that leads to war and not to peace.

Well, believe me, anybody who says America is standing still hasn't been traveling through America--I can assure you of that--as I have.  Look at this great area here. It was built in the last seven years: shopping centers, highways, three times as many schools, more housing, more hospitals, the greatest progress in civil rights not only in this administration--more than in the previous twenty years, more than in eighty years.

I was delighted, too, prior to the time of coming on the stage, to hear you welcome enthusiastically my colleagues who are candidates on my party's ticket in this state. I particularly want to mention my friend, John Tower. You know, I have a pretty good deal of experience in seeing candidates, and I've seen a lot of candidates for the Senate around the country, Democrat and Republican. I will say that there is no candidate that I have seen who, from the standpoint of experience, background, and courage, is more qualified to be a U.S. senator from Texas than John Tower.

You know what would have happened? I've been there. I've been there when the President made great decisions. I remember the morning we went into Lebanon. I remember the President pacing the floor of the oval room in the White House. It was a terrible decision for any man to make, even for a man used to great decisions, because the President knew that if he went in it risked war. He knew that if he didn't go in war would probably be sure because the Communists would sweep down through the Middle East. So, finally, he turned to me. He said, We have got to go in. We went in. That was one of at least ten decisions made in this administration which could have resulted in war if somebody who was rash, somebody who was impulsive, somebody who was inexperienced, had been sitting there in the White House."

I think the first thing that everybody would say he wanted from the government in Washington could be summed up in one word: the word progress. We Americans are a go-ahead people. We're never satisfied with things as they are. That's why we're a great people. That's why, as a matter of fact, California is one of the greatest states, because our people have always been progressive. We wanted to move forward."

I do not suggest to you that if I am elected I will not make mistakes. I do only say, however, that I know what these problems are. I do say that, having been through the fire of decision, as I described it, I do believe that in these years ahead I can avoid some of the mistakes that might come from rashness, from shooting from the hip, from impulsiveness."

First, I have said, and you can hold me to it, I will not - will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,00 a year. You see, I come from the middle class. My dad never made anything near that, even in those dollars back in those days. But I know that the best way to grow our economy is from the middle out and the bottom up. Not the top down, that does not work for most Americans. And so, secondly, I'm going where the money is. The money has gone to the wealthiest of Americans and big corporations in the last 15 years. And if you ask Donald Trump what is his economic policy? It is to give trillions - trillions of dollars in tax cuts to himself, to his family, to the wealthy, to corporations. I just think that's a bad, bad idea."

Yes, yes, we march, we marched for Franklin Roosevelt out of the dark days of the Depression when he said that all we had to fear was fear itself and we marched right on through that Depression and America went on to win a great victory not only over a Depression, but in World War II and we marched with Harry Truman, who told it just like it was and he did something about it, too, for all of us, and we marched and we marched with John F. Kennedy who stood before you eight years ago and said these words to you:  I would like it to be said that in our administration, our country moved, but special emphasis on education, took care of our children and gave medical care to the aged and that we ended discrimination of all kinds in the United States.  He said, and I say, we want fair treatment for all Americans.  that is the Democratic program.  And, my friends, we have been marching to that  music, to Democratic administrations, and we passed Medicare and more aid to education to help our children than any other administration in the history of this country and we passed more civil rights legislation and we have done more for our job training and more opportunity than any political party or any administration.  That's why we are proud to be Democrats.  And you can tell your grandchildren that you were there when America awoke from eight years of fitful sleep, the great GOP slumber, and moved forward once again under Kennedy, under Johnson, and now under Humphrey and Muskie.  Yes, Mr. Nixon says, and now listen to what he says, because really it's hard to understand what he says.  It's a little confusing.  Listen to what he says.  He says, If you elect Hubert Humphrey, it will be more of the same.  And you know, that fellow is beginning to tell the truth.  It's new Nixon when it comes to that.

I will talk about real ideas: of making health care available to the poorest of the poor, controlling what you pay when you go to a doctor; about reforming welfare, giving our kids what they deserve, the world's very best schools. My policies will strengthen the most important institution in our nation, and I am talking about the American family. The liberals are trying to back us away from discussing how to strengthen the family, and we are going to stay with it.

At one time, not long ago, all the institutions of the adult world worked together in the interest of children. Movies and music condemned drug use. Nancy Reagan set a simple standard of Just say no, and politicians of both parties pounded that message home. Parents became more educated and involved, partly because the media made them more educated. We communicated a clear, unmistakable message. And we made a clear, unmistakable difference."

My central goal is to raise our sights, raise our standards, and raise our expectations. Jack Kemp and I are going to get this economy moving again with a pro-growth plan that starts with a phased-in tax cut of 15 percent across the board. We're also going to help lower- and middle-income families with a $500 tax credit for every child they are raising."

For it is a very solemn hour indeed, freighted with the hopes and fears of millions of mankind who see in us, the Democratic Party, sober understanding of the breadth and depth of the revolutionary currents in the world. Here and abroad they see in us awareness that there is no turning back, that, as Justice Holmes said, We must sail sometimes with the wind, sometimes against it; but we must sail and not drift or lie at anchor. They see in us, the Democratic Party that has steered this country through a storm of spears for twenty years, an understanding of a world in the torment of transition from an age that has died to an age struggling to be born. They see in us relentless determination to stand fast against the barbarian at the gate, to cultivate allies with a decent respect for the opinion of others, to patiently explore every misty path to peace and security, which is the only certainty of lower taxes and a better life."

Now, actually it doesn't make any difference whether it is Republican or Democratic rascality; a bad public servant is a bad apple and you throw out a bad apple whatever its variety. That is what I believe and I think that is what we are going to do at every level of our government, if the people are conscious enough of what their responsibility is. But rascals in government are only the uglier practices of wasters in government. Economy is just as important as honesty--for a taxpayer's dollar that is wasted is just as bad as a taxpayer's dollar that is stolen. And here again I lay what I hope is not an immodest claim to some hard and educational experience in making both ends of a government budget meet, in keeping a government lean and trimmed down to an efficient size. I have some idea about that; as the product of practical experience in Illinois, I have learned that economy in government isn't just something that you say you are going to have. You have to grind at it all of the time. You have to grind--everybody--up and down the ladder; the purchasing officers who spend millions of the taxpayers' money, the fellows who deal around in government orders, even the girls who want to use a fresh carbon every time they want to write a letter.

He observed that they consistently vote for local and private interests and against the interest of the people as a whole.

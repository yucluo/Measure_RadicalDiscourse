8.32595410649022e-05,0.999916740458935,1037_2,0,"Now, you know, I wouldn't say, my friends, that this proves conclusively that the Old Guard Republicans are really Communists, but I suppose if I were an Old Guard Republican I would, because that is exactly the way they argue. The great transformation which has overtaken our country in these twenty years has come about, in great part, because we have had a new spirit and a new purpose in our government--you could almost feel the change from confusion to confidence, from fear to faith, when the election of 1932 produced a great new leader, Franklin Roosevelt. And that was only the beginning of the process by which America began to lift itself out of the depths, both economically and spiritually, and onto a new plane of social responsibility and of decency. Government assumed responsibilities to avert economic catastrophe and to assure reasonable levels of security for the people. By doing this, great new energies within the people were unlocked. Of course, this new activity on the part of government aroused resentment. The Old Guard began raising their tired old refrain of socialism, and regimentation; you have heard these cries against every new idea in American history since the post office and the public schools."

They are awful keen about this law enforcement, but they continue to use all these devices in their own posts. So it is a little incongruous. They say, By gosh, we are going to clean up crime in this community and get those slot machines out of that corner saloon. But of course, as far as our Legion Post, or VFW, or whatever it is, that belongs to us and it is certainly a different situation. And after all, the device is set to give the fellow at least a sixty to a hundred chance of winning as against one chance in a hundred in the commercial device; and, after all, we own the machine, and it is not owned by a syndicate of operators and placed on a rental basis. And so on and so on."

We can win peace in the world without a third world war, but only by dedicating our minds and our hearts, our sweat and our blood to that great task for as long as may be necessary. I tell you that the way to our goal is not easy, but the goal is worth the price, for the goal is nothing less than a nation fair and productive beyond our dreams and a world of law and order where men of good will can live together in equal dignity and under God. This is the future that we seek and this is the future for which I know we are willing to work and to sacrifice and to labor with all of our minds and with all of our hearts, and this is the cause to which we call you. We don't call it a crusade--we just call it, Forward with America."
7.87038001836048e-05,0.999921296199816,1047_1,0,"There is some very important business before our nation, as you all know, and it encourages me to think that these many groups we see all the time have a strong feeling we had better leave the management of our affairs in the hands of the Democratic party. And one reason for this is that it has become harder and harder instead of easier and easier to tell precisely what the Republican party stands for in this campaign. I confess it is early in the morning to be harsh about anybody and to be very critical of anybody. I don't want to be critical or harsh. I have in mind that we are now only a week from our election and we still don't know precisely what the Republicans propose to do about much of anything. We know where they stand on the matter of a new labor relations law, for example. That is precisely where they stood for the past five years. That is an old Republican position."
8.89118728915603e-05,0.999911088127108,1054_5,0,"I think, regardless of political considerations, that it is essential that if we are going to win in the long term this conflict with Communists--this conflict with a society that seeks to spread itself over the entire globe--that we must recognize that until we find the means--and until we find cooperation in the means of restoring a sense of well-being to peoples who know little of freedom in the terms that we understand it, that we will have a very threatening and a hostile enemy. That is why one can believe that the importance of bolstering our defenses by the foreign aid programs--Point Four, and things of that kind--are essential if we are going to hope to frustrate the designs of this godless tyranny throughout the world. I thank you so much for affording me this opportunity of participating even briefly in the ceremonies. I count you very fortunate indeed to have this splendid housing development in your neighborhood; and I can add that I am very jealous of it. I should like to be participating in a similar project in Chicago where we too have desperate need of the advantages of public housing."
9.20691437074156e-05,0.999907930856293,1083_5,0,"Democratic administrations have fought to bring these things to you, not because that would win votes, but because they were right and just and fair.  And we are going to continue to shout and do what we think is right to extend the gains that we have made here at home, and to fight for peace abroad. In the conduct of our foreign affairs we will suffer no tyranny over us, just as we will suffer no tyranny of one American over another.  We want to impose no tyranny on any other people.  We will remain free ourselves--more so.  We will find, as we have found before, the balance between the power we generate and the brakes that will check the power of those hostile to us.  In this way we can move in the wide open world as our fathers did when our nation was founded, and we can move unafraid.  I am reluctant to stop, although I have talked entirely too much, both here and all throughout this campaign.  All the same I have left much unsaid that is in my heart.  All I can do now is to thank all of you and, through you, thank all Americans for the privilege of your attention in these past months."
8.35298454351097e-05,0.999916470154565,1092_20,0,"I started my troop duty in the days when we were digging trenches along the Mexican border.  In those days, war traveled no faster than a horse's jog.  I ended my last tour with troops in May of this year.  By then, the pace of war had stepped up to the speed of the jet plane and the impact of the atomic bomb."
9.6549747869809e-05,0.99990345025213,1101_15,0,"We are in that war because this administration allowed America, in a time when strength was needed, to become weak.  Consequently it felt compelled to take its forces out of that region. We are in that war because, having helped set up the Korean Republic, and knowing that strength was being massed against that republic north of its borders, there was a failure to build up adequate strength in Korea's own defense forces."
8.22141633256753e-05,0.999917785836674,1103_1,0,"My three days have carried me into quite a few corners of our country, so you may be interested in a few observations that I think are accurate. My first two days were spent in six southern cities. I was interested to see what were the subjects that seemed to interest them most, subjects involving national problems and the national scene, and then to compare those with similar reactions in the north. In my opinion they are identical."
9.74784575258928e-05,0.999902521542474,1114_3,0,"So, in all of our problems of the preservation of Constitutional forms, in the determination that Communism shall not take over our government, in the determination that Communism abroad shall not present to us an unbearable threat, let us remember this:  We are first of all defending the basic tenets of our Constitutional government that each man is a spiritual being created in the image of his God. Once we have gotten that thought in our minds so that we never forget it, ladies and gentlemen, we can clean out corruption.  Why, think of it, think of the votes we can roll up on November 4th.  We can bring down taxes; we can stop the terrific taxes that are piling up your prices.  An economist came into me the other day, one of these fellows, you know, that dig out the facts.  Every time you eat a boiled egg, unless you raise it yourself, you pay 100 taxes on that egg, one hundred taxes and then we wonder where the prices come from."
8.12072285110777e-05,0.999918792771489,1156_13,0,"No one, not even the blindest partisan, can call this a proud record.  At times the pitiless pressure of Communism has been checked by brave emergency attempts that rallied men of all parties to make up the deficiencies in our national leadership.  These attempts have produced the economic help of the Marshall Plan and the program of military aid to Greece and Turkey.  Both were enactments of the Republican 80th Congress, the Congress so long vilified by the administration.  These measures have helped to steady both the economic and the nervous systems of our allies.  They could hardly have been expected to do more in the making of our foreign policy.  Dollars and guns are no substitute for brains and willpower."
9.00614270985768e-05,0.999909938572901,1158_2,0,"I get up early in the morning and I talk all day long.  By evening my vocal chords are showing the strain and my disposition and everything else.  But then I think of you people who work not only on an intensive basis like that part of the time, but all the time, keeping the party together, keeping it financed, keeping it presented properly before all the people, and I realize what public service really means.  It is not just the limelight, although sometimes these lights are pretty bright, at that.  It is the day by day chore."
8.74798872082828e-05,0.999912520112792,1166_11,0,"In short the entire government will work for the good of 155 million people, not just for this group, for that group, but for all Americans.  Now, in this crowd, ladies and gentlemen, there are numbers of men who are my old comrades in arms.  Some of them may have fought in the Far Pacific; some may have had duties that kept them in the U.S.; many of them went abroad with me.  And I used to see those fellows along the roads, in the camps, sometimes at reviews, in their barracks, in their kitchen, wherever; and we used to talk about why we were fighting.  And we came to the agreement in simple terms that we were fighting to keep America the kind of land that we believe it to be--a land of freedom and opportunity, not a land dominated by a Hitler or by any group of bureaucrats.  The reason I am in this political campaign, my friends, is in a continuation of that promise.  I am trying to do my part to keep America the kind of country we have always known, which means first of all that you must have a government you can respect and other nations will likewise respect it because you do."
7.16918541015506e-05,0.999928308145898,1170_2,0,"Now, that is the kind of recommendation that is easy to carry out.  What I am discussing as I go around is the incompetent leadership you have gotten over the past seven years from your administration in Washington.  And I go into the various subjects of our lack of progress toward peace, our excessive expenditures on the federal level, the deficits that are cheapening our money, the crises that are going up, the taxes that grow more and more burdensome; and, with all of the necessary expenditures for defense organisms that we must have, still a kind of incompetence in government that gets two airfields in North Africa for the price of five and the kind of thing going on in the Justice Department that led an ex-under secretary, a high official in the Justice Department, to say only yesterday, Why, if my ex-chief should tell all he knew, they would blow the White House so high that the power of gravity could not bring it back."
8.43459543770658e-05,0.999915654045623,1213_8,0,"If we do that, ladies and gentlemen, then we are a truly religious civilization, marching forward under a firm leadership, a united leadership that is bound to bring us, first, peace in the world, greater prosperity at home, with that kind of distribution of that prosperity that allows every single loyal American of good will to work for the betterment of himself, his family, his community and America. I don't come before you, ladies and gentlemen, to make any long list of promises.  All the promises, the political promises, have been used up in the last 20 years anyway.  What I bring to you is a pledge, a pledge couched in the kind of thing that you people have a right to demand and expect of your government, that if you want to send the leaders of this crusade to Washington; they make this pledge now, they will above all things be honest; they will make it possible for all the agencies of the government that have the task of investigating--to make it possible for them to make their findings open to the public.  There will be no concealing of crookedness and dirt in the new administration."

0.000102010927899015,0.999897989072101,1222_3,0,"If on top of that we have the military force we need then we are strong.  But how will we do all those things?  We will do them ladies and gentlemen only if we are a united people, united behind the great aspirations and purposes of our government.  And right there is the crux of the matter.  You must have a government that you trust, respect and believe in, if you are going to have a united United States.  A united United States would be a strong bulwark of peace.  A united strong United States can lead the free nations of the world into that kind of collective security program that will lift a great burden from our hearts:  the burden of fear abroad."
7.84144080599381e-05,0.99992158559194,1226_0,0,"My first and most pleasant duty, of course, is to thank you for coming out here today.  You give me a chance to look in your faces, to bring you a word of greeting, and to give you one or two of the thoughts that are on my mind as we go through this political campaign.  I have had a wonderful day and a half in your state, starting up at Sacramento.  It seems to me I have been covering ground very rapidly and every place there seems to be a new surprise.  Now, for example, here when the so-called professional politicians began to give me my lessons in this new art a few months back, they told me there was one thing you could not do-go to an airport and address a group of American citizens.  I was told they simply wouldn't come.  So I find out today that at least in Long Beach those political friends of mine were wrong, and I am delighted."
9.0126248030307e-05,0.999909873751969,1236_7,0,It is wonderful to visit Houston and see on every hand the signs of your vigorous expansion.  You have fulfilled the vision of those hardy pioneers who set up the early capital of the Texas republic down at the corner of Main Street and Texas Avenue.  You have vindicated their resolute belief in the unlimited future of this region.  Your growth has been phenomenal--the vast industrial development ringing the city; your beautiful churches; your Rice Institute; your University of Houston; your wonderful medical center; and your other institutions of culture and learning.

This is the faith--not in the fiction of the abstract common man, but in the wondrous fact that every man is an uncommon man.  He is the infinitely precious, utterly unique individual of living flesh, whose spirit has such strength that he can endure and survive oppression and poverty, disease and imprisonment, to keep alive his soul's love of freedom."

8.93500603152558e-05,0.999910649939685,1309_5,0,"Then they began to fear that my associates and I would bring about a depression, that we would like suddenly to see the United States broke, go into an economic collapse.  But it happens that we have been the ones who are preaching that the greater fear and the threat of our time is Communism, and the only way to fight Communism is with a prosperous America--an America that is fully employed, with working men and women at good jobs with good pay, with farmers prosperous.  We preached that and taught it and carried it everywhere.  So they had to abandon that."

You put Ike and his friends in the administration and they will fire civil servants by the scores.  That is just bunk.  I have lived with those people a whole lot longer than some of the people who are now criticizing me and I like and admire them.

The Democratic platform endorses these proposals. Senator Paul Douglas and other Democrats have already introduced bills in Congress to establish such programs. I hope that when Congress reconvenes they can, with a White House endorsement they have so far lacked, be enacted into law."
8.12649797788049e-05,0.999918735020221,1337_28,0,"The twenty-six years of Republican government have produced a record largely of stagnation, of complacency, and of drift. The Republican leadership cannot hope to meet the challenge of the future--because it can hardly bear to live in the present. The pace of change is quickening every moment, with every new discovery in our laboratories, every new invention in our workshops, every new upsurge of human ambition and hope in the revolutionary turbulence of the world. To meet the challenge of the twentieth century we need every resource of imagination, of intelligence, of courage, and of faith."
8.46201082913932e-05,0.999915379891709,1357_16,0,"The most obvious weakness, of course, is the ease with which our national forests, our wildlife refuges, our parks and streams, and public lands have been invaded and turned to selfish private purpose. But more important even than that, perhaps, is the shunting aside of men who are experienced and trained in a lifetime of conservation work, in favor of politician appointees. The agency that looked at tomorrow's needs for minerals has been disbanded--and nothing put in its place. The Soil Conservation Service has been weakened--and must be revived. We need the leadership that will look at the nation's needs for water, for areas of recreation in the great open country, for land, and forest, and streams. We need, in other words really to look together at the needs and resources of our common future."

First of all, we must rededicate ourselves to our faith in democracy and make that faith a living principle. In the Middle East, Israel is a beacon of democratic faith and of twentieth century progress. Our policy, therefore, should be founded on the firm cornerstone of the friendship of the American people for its democratic friend--Israel. For three years we have tried the ignoble, expedient policy of isolating Israel and trying to buy the friendship of dictators. Colonel Nasser has given us his answer. Appeasement has once again proved neither wise nor honorable nor expedient."

Nixon would probably be president of this country within the next four years. I say frankly, as a citizen more than a candidate, that I recoil at the prospect of Mr. Nixon as custodian of this nation's future, as guardian of the hydrogen bomb, as representative of America in the world, as Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces. Distasteful as it is, this is the truth, the central truth, about the most fateful decision the American people have to make tomorrow. I have full confidence in that decision."

This train is headed not only south, but it is headed toward Washington.  I think in many ways the election of 1960 comes at a time more dangerous for our country, more trying for all of us, a period of greater responsibility for every citizen than any election since the election of 1860.  In that time, as you recall, the great issue was whether this country could stay united, whether it would, in the words of Lincoln, exist half slave and half free.  The issue in the election of 1960 involves not only the well-being of the people of this valley, involves not only the development of your natural resources, but as citizens of the United States and leaders of the free world, we must be concerned about such far-off places as the Congo, India, and Indonesia, the security of those countries, as well as the well-being of their people."

I have a different office in Washington than you who work here in the city of Trenton, but I think that all of us who work for the government in one service or another, or all of us who work in other capacities, have a great and common interest in this campaign, and that is the advancement of the interest of the United States--to increase its power and prestige; to make it more secure; to make it possible in a dangerous world, when hazard surrounds us on every side, to make it possible for us to move safely ahead in a world of peace, protecting not only the security of the United States, but holding out the hand of friendship to all those who wish to be associated with us. Other Democratic presidents in this country--Woodrow Wilson, who served in this city, in this state, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman--all faced difficult and dangerous times. The election of 1932, I think, meant the preservation of freedom here in the United States. But I think the election of 1960 may well mean the preservation of freedom all around the globe."

Let me say, as emphatically as I can: those tactics will not work. You may try to praise or condemn one candidate or another. You may try to express, directly or indirectly, your preferences or your doubts, but the American people are not going to be influenced in this election by what the Kremlin does or says or does not say.

I think we need an administration which so regards it. We spend $42 billion on defense every year. Those ships sail the oceans. They protect us but they do not serve our people and the world. I do not regard the distribution of food around the world as a great burden upon us. I regard it as an opportunity, to use our assets in a way which will attract people to the cause of freedom. I am glad that this is our problem, and not starvation. I am glad we can produce more than we can consume, if we share it usefully, for we are our brother's keeper; and if we have great assets in this country, I believe we should hold out the hand of friendship. When hundreds of millions of people stagger through their lives searching for food and we have it, and we are trying to determine which way the world will go, I would rather see our food used in an imaginative way than to argue in kitchens or anyplace else. I want to help people and I want the United States to be identified with that cause as it was in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and Harry Truman."

But I want to say one or two things. I spoke this afternoon at the plowing contest on what I consider to be the number one domestic problem which the United States faces, and that is the sharp decline in agricultural income. I think the farmers of North Dakota and the farmers of South Dakota and of Minnesota and Montana have a very clear choice. The question is which party and which candidate can meet their problems in this state, and meet their in this country. They have heard from the Democratic party and they have heard from the Republican party. I remember when President Truman used to say that the farmers had themselves to blame for their difficulties because they voted Republican in 1952. But I don't hold that view wholly, because in 1952, the farmers were informed that the Republican party stood for 100 percent parity not once but at least three times."

Mr. Nixon said later this week that that statement was false.  He boasts of tremendous power development during the past eight years, and he asserted that the Russians can overtake us only if we did nothing for fifteen years, while they built eight Grand Coulee Dams a year.  That is his charge and what are the facts?  The facts were reported last year by a committee of the U.S. Senate, over which Mr. Nixon occasionally presides.  That committee's findings, and I quote, were Although the United States is still far ahead, the Russians could overtake us in 1975, in fifteen years, unless we speed up or they slow down.  Both countries will have, the Senate said, an equal power generating capacity which will be 337,500,000 kilowatts in 1975."

We have to have better schools and better housing, better jobs with progress.  How are we going to get it?  Well, let me tell you this.  I could tell you that the way to get it is just to leave it to Washington, that Washington is going to provide the jobs and the schools and the progress we need, but that isn't the way it work in this country of ours.  The way to progress in America is not through putting the responsibility on the federal government, but for the federal government to adopt policies that will stimulate the incentive and the creative ability of 180 million free Americans, just such as you here."

So, first, because he is a man who understands power and respects it, because he is a man who will use power if he can get away with it, to accomplish his ends, we must make sure that he never believes he is strong enough and that we are weak enough that he could start something without risking national suicide on his own part. And, so, the first necessity of leadership in these critical years ahead is that the United States must continue to be what she is today--the strongest nation in the world.  And, my friends, we must continue to maintain that advantage that we presently have, and the next president must be prepared to ask the American people for whatever was necessary to maintain it because through that strength in our hands, we serve the cause of peace.  We serve it because we will never use it in aggression.  We will only use it to deter those who would threaten the peace or threaten the freedom of others."

I'll tell you why.  Because we know him.  We know the Communists.  We sat opposite the table with them.  We know what they're trying to do.  Here are fanatical, ruthless men who are determined to conquer the world, determined to conquer it by any means, if necessary.  But when we consider them, then, we've got to recognize that they're going to cause us trouble--they're going to cause us trouble every time they can.

All the criticism in the world of the Eisenhower record in the field of foreign policy isn't going to fool the American people because they know what it is and they like it.  They know that in 1953, when Eisenhower became president, we were in a war.  They know that in these last seven and a half years we got this nation out of one war, we've kept her out of others, and we do have peace without surrender today and they want to continue that kind of leadership."

And so, one, we will keep America strong militarily, and the second thing we will do is this.  We will be firm in our diplomacy.  We know this man as I emphasized.  We know that he doesn't react like the leaders of the free world.  We know that the naive and well-intentioned people who suggest that a concession here or a concession there will lead to peace forget the lessons of history.  My friends, we learned in Korea, we learned in dealing with Hitler, that whenever you're confronted with a dictator the way to peace is to strengthen strength and firmness, and the way to war is through weakness, both militarily and diplomatically.  We stand for strength and firmness and that's what we're going to continue, and that's what the American people are going to vote for on November 8th."

Not because we are for war, because we are not; because we are for peace, because we are the guardians of peace, and because it is essential that as guardians of peace, America must have strength that will discourage any of those who would threaten the peace of the world--and I can assure you that decisions which will be made if I have the opportunity to make them, will be ones that will always put the security of America first.  That must come before any other consideration, and there will never be a dollar sign on what Americans will be able to do in the field of protecting the defense of this country."

Such efforts toward personal security, first, are right--not only from the humanitarian viewpoint, which all of us will understand--they are mandatory if our complex modern society is to work at its best, at its fullest.  They are essential to our purpose.  And what is that purpose?  I think, summed up in a sentence, it is this: we must lift the ceiling over personal opportunity.  We must strengthen the floor over the pit of personal disaster.  Public policy, therefore, should seek to put right what is wrong in our America, but it should also seek to strengthen what is right.  It should recognize the plain fact that Americans are proud and self-reliant individuals.  Programs that encourage individuals to depend on government are wrong, for increasing dependence by a people upon government is not a sign of strength; it is a sign of weakness, and in this day of competition with the Communists, Americans must be sturdy and strong."

The Paris conference, you remember, was the one that Mr. Khrushchev broke up.  He said he broke it up at the time because the President had ordered the U-2 flights, you recall, which were ordered to protect the security of the United States, to get information about whether there was a surprise attack being mounted against the United States, and at that time Mr. Khrushchev demanded that the President of the United States apologize or express regrets for those flights.

We will produce again in all of these areas, in which America wants progress.  But one other point I would make: we will do it not with programs that will raise your taxes, that will raise your prices, and theirs will.  And let me say to every housewife here: if you vote for our opponents, the prices of everything you buy in the grocery store will go up because of their farm program, incidentally, that won't help the farmer either; but it will certainly have that effect, and they know it.  Other prices will go up, and I say, my friends, that the American people want higher wages, yes; they want prosperity, yes; but they want it without inflation, and without war, and that's the kind we produce, and that's the kind you want."

As I look over a crowd like this, as I realize the inconvenience and the discomfort that was caused to you to have to come here, it makes me know what a tremendous and awesome responsibility it is even to be running for president and even to be thinking of the possibility of being president of this country. I can only tell you that, as see this crowd, I will never forget this day in Marion.  I will remember the people who came here, who stood in the rain and who looked at me, listened to what I have to say, and if you believe, and if your verdict will be, that I am the one to serve you, I want you to know that I will do everything in my power in working for a better America, an America in which we can all move forward together, leaving none behind, an America in which the young people of this country will have greater opportunities than we have even had in our time, and a world in which all men can be free, in which we can live in peace."

We will remember that you came out and welcomed us so generously on this visit to Deschler, and we only hope in the years to come we can he worthy of such devotion as you have shown tonight.

Wouldn't it be better, for example, to say--not that we won't be pushed around, but maybe we'll compromise here and there.  Why don't we let Mr. Khrushchev have his part of the world, where the Poles and the Hungarians and the others live, if he will just leave us alone?"

It is vital to everybody in this audience, to everybody in this nation today. There was a time when I could point, for example, to these beautiful young ladies around me, who have escorted Pat and me to this platform, the young ladies from Southern Illinois, most of whom, incidentally, are going to be teachers, and say to them: well, obviously, you are concerned about foreign policy because those who are your future husbands are those who will have to fight the wars in which this country might be engaged."

And, of course, the answer is: being alive is more important."

But, my friends, he will have a chance to catch us if we turn to policies that would stunt the initiative of the American people, that would say, Oh, people can't do things. We've got to turn everything over to Washington. We don't believe in the individual. We're afraid they haven't the responsibility. Listen, it's that kind of policy that we left in 1953 and it's that kind, my friends, that would allow him to catch us, and we're not going to do it.

Now, that doesn't mean that we won't always go the extra mile--and Cabot Lodge and I have some ideas for strengthening the United Nations, for setting up new organizations which can strengthen the cause of peace and freedom throughout the world. But, my friends, I can assure you of this: we are not, under any circumstances, going to enter into any agreements with the Soviet leaders which would surrender freedom any place in the world, because that leads to war and not to peace. President Eisenhower has shown that. That's why he took the position he did on Quemoy and Matsu and on the other great decisions."

He was making statements about foreign policy, not Mr. Kissinger. What he said outraged our allies, and disturbed our people in this country. There are three hundred thousand Soviet troops in Eastern Europe; there are two divisions in Poland. There are three or four divisions in Czechoslovakia. Eight years after the Soviet Union had promised to remove them. There are fifteen divisions in Eastern Germany. They are now building an even stronger Berlin Wall. If they tear down the wall, which way will the people move? They're not free in Eastern Europe. In Hungary there are three divisions, twenty years after the revolution was snuffed out."

Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican president, put through that law, and we honor him for it. But as Theodore Roosevelt himself noted in his autobiography, he put the law through over the bitter opposition of the Old Guard Republicans in Congress. He observed that they consistently vote for local and private interests and against the interest of the people as a whole. And note, too that the original Reclamation Law was sponsored in the House of Representatives by Representative Newlands of Nevada, a Democrat. It passed by the votes of 77 Democrats and 69 Republicans."

6.60515149769178e-05,0.999933948485023,1013_6,0,"Well, the best answer I know to Republican fears is Democratic facts. These facts go back, of course, twenty years. Youngstown was not, in 1932, a pleasant place to work or to live--and Youngstown was typical of most of the cities of America. The steel mills here in the Mahoning Valley were working at 31 percent of capacity. One Youngstown working man out of every three was unemployed. There was no unemployment compensation. The other two men worked at poverty wages. There was no minimum wage law. Those men worked in silence beside the furnaces. There was no collective bargaining act. The foreman's word was law. The working man had no seniority rights in his job and there was almost no collective bargaining contracts; almost no unions. At the end of life's work when you could no longer work, there was nothing. There was no social security. You only knew that one day--and you never knew when--there would be a pink dismissal slip in your envelope, and that would be all. If it was bad at the mill, it was infinitely worse in the street and in the home. Youngstown was one of the first cities to start soup kitchens. So desperate indeed did the city of Youngstown become that the City Council..."
6.21029744378847e-05,0.999937897025562,1023_2,0,"My heart is very much in these programs because whenever you travel through this great land of ours, you can't help but see how much these programs have meant to so many people. Above all, our Democratic platform calls for action on the overshadowing problems of war and peace--the most important unfinished business of our generation--and I mean steady resistance to Communism and patient and persistent efforts to build a peace which has been man's dearest goal from time immemorial. Now, in these few words--if these were all that you knew about me and about our Democratic platform, well, I will have to confess that you wouldn't know very much for it is easy to get up here on a campaign train and say some nice sounding words, but out of our party you get a lot more than some high sounding words--you get first of all the record of twenty years of solid accomplishment, of accomplishment in the interests of all our people, and I hope you will compare this record with the Republican record before you vote--for, by the way, they have a record too during these past twenty years, and it is easy to sum up that record. Whenever there has been a forward looking, a constructive program to oppose, they have opposed it, and that is about all their record amounts to."
7.18429990142308e-05,0.999928157000986,1033_17,0,"But if we deal with this problem foolishly, we risk atomic war, on the one hand, or ignominious surrender, on the other--in either case, the destruction of freedom and civilization. I ask you: to whom should our people entrust the fight against Communism--to those Old Guard Republicans who, on one issue after another, vote the way our enemies like to see them vote? Or to those who have rallied the free world against Communist aggression?"
9.72888772441907e-05,0.999902711122756,1033_28,0,"As I have said repeatedly in this campaign, if I find any Communists or fellow travelers or Soviet agents or dupes in our federal government, I will root them out promptly and ruthlessly. In fighting Communists at home, I shall rely on such experienced guardians of our security as J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and General Bedell Smith of the Central Intelligence Agency. These men fight Communism as it must be fought--with care, thoroughness, precision--and silence."
6.81374477597318e-05,0.999931862552241,1039_6,0,"I am frank to say we have had very little cooperation from some of the veteran's posts. They are awful keen about this law enforcement, but they continue to use all these devices in their own posts. So it is a little incongruous. They say, By gosh, we are going to clean up crime in this community and get those slot machines out of that corner saloon. But of course, as far as our Legion Post, or VFW, or whatever it is, that belongs to us and it is certainly a different situation. And after all, the device is set to give the fellow at least a sixty to a hundred chance of winning as against one chance in a hundred in the commercial device; and, after all, we own the machine, and it is not owned by a syndicate of operators and placed on a rental basis. And so on and so on."
6.31484522391956e-05,0.99993685154776,1040_8,0,"You know, they used to say in Washington in the early days of the war that you were likely to contract one of three diseases--either ulcers, galloping frustration, or a sense of humor. I have never felt better; I feel frustrated only by the difficulty I have had in engaging in any genuine debate with the Republicans; and, as far as my sense of humor is concerned, I hope it is intact. And I hope the time will never come when the Republican party gets into office and forbids any humor in political campaigns."
6.39865562154856e-05,0.999936013443785,1054_5,0,"I think, regardless of political considerations, that it is essential that if we are going to win in the long term this conflict with Communists--this conflict with a society that seeks to spread itself over the entire globe--that we must recognize that until we find the means--and until we find cooperation in the means of restoring a sense of well-being to peoples who know little of freedom in the terms that we understand it, that we will have a very threatening and a hostile enemy. That is why one can believe that the importance of bolstering our defenses by the foreign aid programs--Point Four, and things of that kind--are essential if we are going to hope to frustrate the designs of this godless tyranny throughout the world. I thank you so much for affording me this opportunity of participating even briefly in the ceremonies. I count you very fortunate indeed to have this splendid housing development in your neighborhood; and I can add that I am very jealous of it. I should like to be participating in a similar project in Chicago where we too have desperate need of the advantages of public housing."
5.91430839997223e-05,0.999940856916001,1076_4,0,"We are not only, as I say, a moral country.  This is a brave and a generous country, I think we are bearing our responsibilities well as the strong leader of the free nations against the threat of Soviet communism.  We are doing the hard job that must be done if we are to have a secure place for ourselves and for those children.  We are following out the high ideals of Woodrow Wilson, who wanted to take us our full part--give us our full part--accept our full responsibility for securing the peace back in 1920 after the first World War.  The American people didn't listen to Wilson in those days.  We turned instead to people who led us away from the hard road of international cooperation to the easy  path of isolation.  If we had listened to him we might well have avoided the terrible trial of the second World War, in which 300,000 of our young men died."
6.18824675116213e-05,0.999938117532489,1081_7,0,"     We Democrats are for private and we are for profitable business.  We know America could not survive with any other kind.  We are for the dynamic system of enterprise which has grown out of the great partnership of public and private initiative in this country.  We are against socialism--creeping, crawling, loping, galloping, or even the make-believe kind that takes up so much space in the Republican oratory these days."
6.83160744741133e-05,0.999931683925526,1083_5,0,"Democratic administrations have fought to bring these things to you, not because that would win votes, but because they were right and just and fair.  And we are going to continue to shout and do what we think is right to extend the gains that we have made here at home, and to fight for peace abroad. In the conduct of our foreign affairs we will suffer no tyranny over us, just as we will suffer no tyranny of one American over another.  We want to impose no tyranny on any other people.  We will remain free ourselves--more so.  We will find, as we have found before, the balance between the power we generate and the brakes that will check the power of those hostile to us.  In this way we can move in the wide open world as our fathers did when our nation was founded, and we can move unafraid.  I am reluctant to stop, although I have talked entirely too much, both here and all throughout this campaign.  All the same I have left much unsaid that is in my heart.  All I can do now is to thank all of you and, through you, thank all Americans for the privilege of your attention in these past months."
9.24083077918921e-05,0.999907591692209,1085_15,0,"No, I've seen and heard the deep-throated courage and confidence and faith of strong men and women and happy children--people who still believe in one another, in spite of all the timid, doubting men. And I thank them every one for the reception they have given me--for their infinite courtesy and their heartening friendliness.  I have asked you for your support for my candidacy. I ask you now for support of our common faith in this country. The confidence we've inherited is our greatest wealth, the source of our strength. "
9.00874959161514e-05,0.999909912504084,1130_24,0,"Next, I want to see maintained the Constitutional relationship between the federal and the state governments.  My oath of office would demand that.  My convictions would require it.   The federal government did not create the states in this republic.  The states created the federal government.  The creation should not supersede the creator."
7.62073441997096e-05,0.9999237926558,1146_2,0,"The British over on the left couldn't break out of the fortified town of Cannes, and we didn't know what we were going to do.  A little sergeant--Sergeant Kuhlen--I will never forget his name as long as I live--came up with an idea.  He found that he could put some knives on the front of our tanks that would go in and cut off these hedges.  The tanks could come through straight and come through shooting, and it wasn't very pleasant for the Germans. "
5.92040555011454e-05,0.999940795944499,1156_13,0,"No one, not even the blindest partisan, can call this a proud record.  At times the pitiless pressure of Communism has been checked by brave emergency attempts that rallied men of all parties to make up the deficiencies in our national leadership.  These attempts have produced the economic help of the Marshall Plan and the program of military aid to Greece and Turkey.  Both were enactments of the Republican 80th Congress, the Congress so long vilified by the administration.  These measures have helped to steady both the economic and the nervous systems of our allies.  They could hardly have been expected to do more in the making of our foreign policy.  Dollars and guns are no substitute for brains and willpower."
5.91417304175069e-05,0.999940858269583,1158_2,0,"I get up early in the morning and I talk all day long.  By evening my vocal chords are showing the strain and my disposition and everything else.  But then I think of you people who work not only on an intensive basis like that part of the time, but all the time, keeping the party together, keeping it financed, keeping it presented properly before all the people, and I realize what public service really means.  It is not just the limelight, although sometimes these lights are pretty bright, at that.  It is the day by day chore."
5.90658102531307e-05,0.999940934189747,1179_4,0,"That record is a distinguished one.  It should be remembered that the negative votes on the North Atlantic Treaty, the Vandenberg Resolution and the Marshall Plan included negative votes of the party in power.  That is a tribute not just to a man but to a party.  Senator Vandenberg, if he were living, would be the first one to resent the suggestion that the votes to which I refer represented a personal triumph.  Rather, they represented to him the dedication of a party which, although it was an opposition party, subordinated partisan considerations to the national welfare."
6.04733506935347e-05,0.999939526649307,1181_9,0,"Ladies and gentlemen, my train was late, our time is short, but you have met a part of the Michigan team--Michigan members that must be on this great team to help in cleaning out the Washington mess.  Your governor, your new Senator, your Congressman--we must have them all--and with them and on behalf of all Republicans, I make these pledges to labor, to farmers, to businessmen, to every American:  first, if you want to change administrations this fall, if you want the group that the Republicans can put in the administration and in the Senate and in the House to take charge of this thing--clean it out and start us on a different road than we are now following--then they promise this:  There will be fairness, decency and justice prevailing in that administration, and they will serve you honestly as your servants and will not attempt to be your master.  That is the first pledge they make."
5.8132557028315e-05,0.999941867442972,1184_6,0,"Now if you will permit me one local word before I ask Mrs. Eisenhower to come out to wave to you, it is this:  Just as Michigan State is known for this great football team, and of which I now have a memento, it is also known for one thing that I have preached far and wide--proper agricultural research.  I am glad to have been here to pay tribute to its progress and its record in that field. Now friends, thank you again for turning out.  Let me bring out the better half of the Eisenhower tribe."
6.17105390670506e-05,0.999938289460933,1197_11,0,"There are a lot of other parts to this verbal barrage.  For example, the Republicans are accused of attempting to abolish social security.  Sheer bunk!  What the Republicans have said is this:  our purpose is to keep the dollar from going down further so that there will be no further erosion of your savings account, of your bank account, of your insurance policy and of your bonds.  But instead of seeing those things go down the drain of inflation you will keep them, and moreover they have said that where inflation has already overtaken some of these things, these amounts, and they have gone down below decency, that must be corrected, which means corrected upward.  They have also pledged in their platform to expand social security to go to classes not so far covered."
5.8308500377509e-05,0.999941691499623,1206_6,0,"We will find a better answer than setting up in this region a super-state, a valley authority set up and blueprinted in Washington, D.C. with all of its principal officials appointed from there. Another of those blanks is that the Republican leaders would like to abolish all the gains that labor has made through these last years since the beginning of the century.  Ladies and gentlemen, sheer bunk!  I am not going to take time this morning to outline what the Republican Party is attempting to do in establishing the kind of climate in Washington where the labor-management problems can be settled without strikes, but I am going to repeat just briefly the promise I made to labor on Labor Day.  I said something to this effect: that four years from now, if you people had decided this fall to establish a Republican administration in Washington in the Executive Department, in the Senate of the United States, and in the Congress, that the leaders of that group would hope to stand before a crowd like this at the end of those four years, and each of you could look at the other and honestly say, Those people were fair; they were just; they settled everything on the basis of what is good for the United States of America, not just some particular section or group whose votes they were trying to buy--what was good for the United States of America.  Moreover, they would say and you would say to each other, They protected the rights of all--labor, management, professional men, farmers, everyone.  And finally, you would say, And besides being fair and just, they were friendly.  They were just people who belonged to us, one of us, not a bunch of long-haired bureaucrats in Washington who wanted to rule our lives from 3,000 miles away.  That was the pledge I made and I make it everywhere I go."
6.15477155091266e-05,0.999938452284491,1207_1,0,"You know, this thing seems to me to be particularly significant:  this evening there will be 6,000 more Americans than there were last evening.  Those Americans, of course, are largely our new babies born.  When each baby is born today it gets a very extraordinary present as it arrives into this world:  it gets its share of the national debt; it owes $1,750 for the privilege of having been born."
6.51765447369835e-05,0.999934823455263,1216_15,0,"Now, let us talk for just a moment about these goals that all of us who are in this crusade are supporting.  Now, I do not mean just the purpose of supplanting a worn-out administration in Washington.  That is merely the first step.  This crusade of cleaning out an inept and bungling administration will take as its first job that of cleaning out corruption."
6.2564930364635e-05,0.999937435069635,1216_17,0,"Now, of course, with the expenditure programs that are required today for necessary purposes, there cannot be any escape for the moment from high costs and high taxes and high prices.  Which makes it all the more necessary that we watch with a jaundiced eye anything that is unnecessary--all of the waste, the duplication, the inefficiency that we know about, and which you would not expect me here today at this time to enumerate.  That must be eliminated and it is the second purpose of this crusade."
0.000112963735468901,0.999887036264531,1220_40,0,"In this enterprise which I describe, we are not trying to remake the world in the image of America.  We are not trying to force any man to our way if it is not his.  We are not trying to buy peace or bring peace with the sword."
8.04733839447886e-05,0.999919526616055,1236_7,0,It is wonderful to visit Houston and see on every hand the signs of your vigorous expansion.  You have fulfilled the vision of those hardy pioneers who set up the early capital of the Texas republic down at the corner of Main Street and Texas Avenue.  You have vindicated their resolute belief in the unlimited future of this region.  Your growth has been phenomenal--the vast industrial development ringing the city; your beautiful churches; your Rice Institute; your University of Houston; your wonderful medical center; and your other institutions of culture and learning.
5.80072399333445e-05,0.999941992760067,1266_7,0,"But finally and more important than that, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few weeks I have gone up and down the length of this land.  I have promised farmers that when they have problems, bring those problems to Washington.  If the United States chooses to place on me and my associates in this crusade the responsibility for conducting the national governmental affairs during the next four years, each of these problems will be solved only after complete consultation with the people affected.  I have made that promise and that pledge to farmers.  I have pledged that to labor.  On Labor Day I said, The pledge that this crusade makes you is this:  We would be firm, we would be just, we would be fair, but we will be friendly.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is what I should say that a new administration could do instantly on this problem.  Not only could they bring in advice, general advisors and consultants on the whole problem of promotion of small industries throughout our country, but they could bring in specifically, from this area people of management and business and investment and labor, the men who are working and out of work, bring them in and say, Let us find out what we can do here, what can the federal government do legitimately without interfering with your lives, but in a friendly, helpful sort of way that will both to the benefit of the federal government and to this city."
5.96621975396881e-05,0.99994033780246,1270_17,0,"We must call upon the best minds of our nations to sit down with political and economic leaders of other nations to find solutions to the crucial problems of international economic policy.  I believe that the wrecking of the London Economic Conference of 1933 was one of the great, though little understood, tragedies of our modern world.  We must make a fresh start."
5.68193076781017e-05,0.999943180692322,1280_3,0,"We have got to get dedicated men and women from all over this United States who have been living closer to the people, who have not grown arrogant by being too long in power, who have not gotten too complacent or indifferent or think they can sell any bill of goods of fear and despair to America and so secure its votes. Now, if we are going to have a fresh start on this thing, we have got to have a complete change in the political complexion in Washington.  I picked up this morning a little clipping.  I am going to read to you just two sentences:  In South Bend, Indiana, yesterday, someone from the crowd addressed by the Democratic candidate, the administration's hand-picked candidate, shouted this question, Would you fire Acheson?   And it says here, Dean Acheson, the Secretary of State, and the answer was this, I will answer questions like that after the election, the Governor replied.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is the only answer the poor man could make.  He has the record, this sorry record of the last seven years to defend, and here is one he can't defend; but he can't on the other hand, say in advance, I repudiate that record and the people who have made it.  But I say, this crusade in which I am engaged does repudiate that record of error, and we are ready to replace from top to bottom.  No one has anything but admiration for the great body of public servants of America who are contained in the civil service and in the uniformed services.  We are talking, in this top to bottom clean-out, about these political appointees, the policy-makers, if you please, of our country--and not only in domestic policy but in this foreign field."
6.10100736932373e-05,0.999938989926306,1302_2,0,"And now, my friends, when this campaign started, we were promised--a very high-sounding promise, put in very nicely-flowing words--that the United States was going to be given the spectacle of a political contest conducted on such a plane, the opposition said that we would be all educated and elevated.  It was a very, very wonderful promise.  I sincerely appreciated it, but what has happened?  If you are going to educate, you have to start with the record, with the facts.  Who among you here would like the job of defending the record of the government of the past seven years?  Well, I don't have to ask that one again.  Of course, they can't defend that record, a record in which, with all of the assets and resources of this great nation with which we came out of World War II, they have frittered them away--as they have struggled and fumbled and stumbled and fallen in the foreign field.  They have brought us no closer to peace.  We have had these emergencies after emergencies.  We have lost China.  We have lost souls, human souls, to the Communistic dictatorship in the Kremlin at the rate of 100 million per year."
6.32074946909234e-05,0.999936792505309,1304_4,0,"Just one or two items that are in this program of fear, and I will be on my hasty way through this section of New York state. They fear, they say, that these Republican, Independent and enlightened Democratic friends of mine will bring on a depression; that we may be able to lead the country toward peace, but if we do, there will be no jobs, men will be out of work, there will be breadlines--all that sort of bunk.  Now, the first thing that is necessary to lead our country toward peace is a strong America; and the first thing that means a strong America is an employed America--a prosperous America--that stands as an example of what free government can do for its citizens in this world.  That is the purpose to which this crusade is dedicated."
6.39219093559076e-05,0.999936078090644,1312_11,0,"What is extraordinary is that the present administration continues to pretend that none of these things have been so--that everything that has happened--every stolen secret, every disloyal official--is, they say, just an unfortunate, almost insignificant, accident. We could make some allowance for them if they had the honesty or the common sense, or both, to admit that they had been deceived and to show a stern purpose of preventing similar subversion in the future. There has been considerable concern--and rightfully so--about methods to be used in rooting Communism out of our government."
6.35582432654391e-05,0.999936441756734,1313_9,0,"Every single member in this crusade is pledged to this idea: That at the first sign of any approaching depression, the full power of private industry, of local and state government, and all resources of federal government will be mobilized to see that never again will we have mass unemployment.  We are committed to the expansion and improvement of social security programs, particularly to saving what is left of our dollars so that your insurance policies, your old age insurance, your unemployment insurance and the rest of itdon't run out of your pocket through that big hole they call inflation.  Unless we stop that, there is no hope."

My friend Chris Herter has broad experience and a warm concern for people which fit him to be a great governor of your great state. I stand before you, tonight, in the solemn knowledge that--by this hour of the morrow--you may have summoned me to serve as president of the United States."

We can preserve the position of the small business without injury to the large. We can strengthen labor unions and collective bargaining as vital institutions in a free economy. We can and our party history proves that we will!"
7.42054814988783e-05,0.999925794518501,1326_14,0,"There is not peace--real peace--while more than half of our federal budget goes to an armaments race with the most powerful military despotism the world has ever known, and the earth's atmosphere is contaminated from week to week by exploding hydrogen bombs. There is not peace--which can only mean world peace--while millions chafe in Communist chains. In Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and even some parts of Latin America, ugly tension and unbridled nationalism are mixed up, often in dangerous ways, with hopes and aspirations we all respect. "
6.19033022779273e-05,0.999938096697722,1335_23,0,"The Republican congressman from this very district, Mr. Hyde, said of the classroom problem, There is not a state in this Union which cannot afford to take care of that need. Another Republican congressman suggested that classes were too small and that they should go into the evening and run twelve months of the year. And, though President Eisenhower was nominally in favor of aid to education, this particular congressman on April 12, 1956, read into the Record a letter from the President in which Mr. Eisenhower said, I would flatly oppose any grant by the federal government to all states in the Union for educational purposes. I am perplexed to say the least, but contradiction--unilateral as well as multilateral--seems to be about the only entertainment these Republicans have contrived."

That was when he said, on October 30, 1953, that he favored the election of every Republican over every Democrat for every office any place. And that is the course he has pursued ever since. He has not hesitated to endorse any Republican, be he a Taft Republican or a McCarthy Republican. The only notable exception was an Eisenhower Republican--Senator Wiley of Wisconsin, for whom the President didn't lift a finger. It used to be said that Mr. Eisenhower would reshape the Republican party. You cannot help but wonder today who has reshaped whom."

6.21832132651685e-05,0.999937816786735,1374_1,0,I suggest to you that both the reputation of the Republican party and the reputation of the Democratic party are undeserved. I would go further.

In that time, as you recall, the great issue was whether this country could stay united, whether it would, in the words of Lincoln, exist half slave and half free.  The issue in the election of 1960 involves not only the well-being of the people of this valley, involves not only the development of your natural resources, but as citizens of the United States and leaders of the free world, we must be concerned about such far-off places as the Congo, India, and Indonesia, the security of those countries, as well as the well-being of their people."

There are 15 million American homes, according to the last Bureau of the Census, which are substandard.  Mr. Nixon has issued a paper on housing, and this, I think, is most revealing of all and one of the most endearing qualities of the Vice President.  In his position paper issued in New York within the last three weeks, he says that the Housing Act of 1949 has worked very well, and do you know as a congressman he voted against it?  In that position paper he called for greater emphasis on middle-income housing and he voted against that in 1950.  He calls for a greater flow of housing credit so that the American people can buy houses at low rates of interest.  But he neglects to mention his vote as vice president to increase the interest rates on the GI housing bans.  High interest rates never built a single home and one of the reasons why we are building 200,000 less homes each year than we should to keep up with our population increase is because of the high interest rate policy of this administration."

But what is the area of difference between us?  What is the issue on which you should base your decision?  You should not only make a judgment of Mr. Nixon and myself.  You should also make a judgment about yourselves, what you want, about what your view is of your country and your community, about what your view of the future is, whether you are satisfied today or wish to do better.  If you are satisfied, if you feel happy about your life, if you feel our country is meeting its responsibilities, then you belong in Mr. Nixon's camp.  But if you share the view that I hold very vigorously that this country is going to have to do better in the future, that we have responsibilities to meet not only to ourselves but to the cause of freedom, that we are anxious to make sure that in the future people decide that these days were great days in the life of our country, that we must move forward, we must stimulate our growth, we must hold out an image to the world of a vigorous, dynamic society, if we are going to continue to lead the free world--I believe that is the choice.

Mr. Nixon has run on a slogan that we have never had it so good.  It indicates his belief that we are moving in a period now, to quote him, of unparalleled prosperity, that the United States is moving in a position of strength and vitality, and that everything that must be done is being done in good measure.  He looks around the world and he sees the United States with our prestige at an all-time high, and that of the Communists at an all-time low.  I look at the world and I look at the United States, and I don't see his picture at all, and I am not, as the Democratic candidate for office, going to run for the presidency in 1960 with any belief or any view that it is worthwhile getting elected president if we have to run on a platform which is totally unrealistic.  This country is not moving ahead like it is going to have to move ahead if we are going to meet our responsibilities to ourselves, to those who come after us, to those who look to us around the world for leadership.  And our position in the world is not unparalleled; our prestige has been higher.  Our strength relative to that of the Communists has been greater.  If Mr. Nixon hopes to be president of the United States and present the United States to the world in the same image that he now presents it in this campaign, I could not disagree with him more.  I hope you share the view with me that we want the truth with the bark off.  The people of the United States want to face the facts.  You share the same view that I do, that this country's potential is unlimited.  There is no responsibility, no burden, no hazard that the United States cannot meet, but it certainly cannot meet those hazards unless the leadership is prepared to tell the truth."

But again, we don't stand on it.  How do I say that we can do this job?  Well, first, when you look at my colleague and I, we know Mr. Khrushchev.  We have sat down across the conference table with him.  We know that he is a man who is ruthless and tough.  We know that you must never make him a concession unless you get a concession in return.  That's why President Eisenhower was right in not doing what Mr. Khrushchev asked him to do again in the paper this morning, in not apologizing and not expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev as Senator Kennedy suggested he might.  That is why the next president of the United States must recognize that Mr. Khrushchev does not react like Mr. Nehru, he isn't like Mr. Adenauer, or Mr. Macmillan.  He is a man determined to conquer the world and so, first, we will keep America strong--the strongest in the world.  Second, we will see that the economy of this country moves forward so that Mr. Khrushchev never will be able to get through on his boast that he is going to catch us.  Third, we will see that we are firm, but we will never be belligerent, because we realize that while we hold the line for principle, we must always negotiate for peace, but never, again, making concessions, as I say, which don't get concessions in return."

They know  it.  They're going to pour in, without any question, hundreds of thousands of paid workers, in many instances.  I say hundreds of thousands.  That may be an exaggeration.  There certainly will be thousands of paid workers in some of the key industrial states.  They will be poured into this campaign.  We've got to combat them with volunteers, because that's all we have, but a good volunteer worker can always beat a paid worker, if he works, and so I say let's outwork them and outfight them in these last three weeks, and we'll win Arizona and the nation.

And so, one, we will keep America strong militarily, and the second thing we will do is this.  We will be firm in our diplomacy.  We know this man as I emphasized.  We know that he doesn't react like the leaders of the free world.  We know that the naive and well-intentioned people who suggest that a concession here or a concession there will lead to peace forget the lessons of history.  My friends, we learned in Korea, we learned in dealing with Hitler, that whenever you're confronted with a dictator the way to peace is to strengthen strength and firmness, and the way to war is through weakness, both militarily and diplomatically.

We must widen opportunities for all.  We must improve the quality of educational effort.  We must enhance the status of our teachers.  To that end, I have proposed a national program in support of education, emphasizing such elements as college scholarships for those who cannot under any circumstances afford to borrow and to pay back, tax credits or deductions to cover tuition and other costs of higher education, aid in school construction to provide needed facilities, and thereby to release local funds for raising teachers' salaries--all of this, however, particularly at the secondary and primary level, to be accomplished without compromising local controls of our school system."

The federal government is going to promise you this, that, and the other thing.

Well, you know, that's like the old medicine man who used to come to town--the same remedy for everything--spend more money--and that's your money. Now, the difference was, you know, that the medicine man had the same remedy--different labels on the bottle--it would cure snakebite or rheumatism or anything else, but it really didn't do it; and the difference was the medicine man always got out of town just before the people caught up with the fact that the remedy didn't work.

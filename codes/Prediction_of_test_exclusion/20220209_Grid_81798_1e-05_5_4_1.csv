Are these the men we want to lead our nation in the struggle against Communism today? All the while they proclaim ferocious anti-Communism. Indeed, the best way they can apparently find to obscure their retreat from the fight against Communism abroad, the fight to keep it distant from our shores, is by shouting and screaming every hour on the hour about how much they hate Communism at home."
8.01403360911392e-05,0.999919859663909,1037_2,0,"Now, you know, I wouldn't say, my friends, that this proves conclusively that the Old Guard Republicans are really Communists, but I suppose if I were an Old Guard Republican I would, because that is exactly the way they argue. The great transformation which has overtaken our country in these twenty years has come about, in great part, because we have had a new spirit and a new purpose in our government--you could almost feel the change from confusion to confidence, from fear to faith, when the election of 1932 produced a great new leader, Franklin Roosevelt. And that was only the beginning of the process by which America began to lift itself out of the depths, both economically and spiritually, and onto a new plane of social responsibility and of decency. Government assumed responsibilities to avert economic catastrophe and to assure reasonable levels of security for the people. By doing this, great new energies within the people were unlocked. Of course, this new activity on the part of government aroused resentment. The Old Guard began raising their tired old refrain of socialism, and regimentation; you have heard these cries against every new idea in American history since the post office and the public schools."
7.348089482065e-05,0.999926519105179,1039_3,0,"Mr. Chairman, I just happened to run across one thing that a group was doing in some town in Illinois which is illustrative of what I mean by the variety of possibilities. They were merely beautifying the state highway at the access point of the city, where it began to come into the city. And where it had been shabby and ugly and messy they were cleaning it up around there and developing a picnic area--that sort of thing--and an infinite variety of things. Also, of course, from the point of view of the public official, it is a wonderful access point to communities."
6.88386840815058e-05,0.999931161315919,1047_1,0,"There is some very important business before our nation, as you all know, and it encourages me to think that these many groups we see all the time have a strong feeling we had better leave the management of our affairs in the hands of the Democratic party. And one reason for this is that it has become harder and harder instead of easier and easier to tell precisely what the Republican party stands for in this campaign. I confess it is early in the morning to be harsh about anybody and to be very critical of anybody. I don't want to be critical or harsh. I have in mind that we are now only a week from our election and we still don't know precisely what the Republicans propose to do about much of anything. We know where they stand on the matter of a new labor relations law, for example. That is precisely where they stood for the past five years. That is an old Republican position."
7.8162892112274e-05,0.999921837107887,1073_22,0,"Greece and Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean were saved by prompt action by President Truman and the Congress and they were saved in spite of the blind obstruction of the Old Guard Republicans. Who gave us the Marshall Plan which prevented the Kremlin's bloodless conquest of Western Europe? Who faced up to the Russians in Berlin when they tried to strangle and seize that city? Who insisted on the heroic airlift and who was it that hammered out the North Atlantic Alliance, which banded together the free people of Europe in a united defense against Communist aggression?"
8.15239891951369e-05,0.999918476010804,1076_4,0,"We are not only, as I say, a moral country.  This is a brave and a generous country, I think we are bearing our responsibilities well as the strong leader of the free nations against the threat of Soviet communism.  We are doing the hard job that must be done if we are to have a secure place for ourselves and for those children.  We are following out the high ideals of Woodrow Wilson, who wanted to take us our full part--give us our full part--accept our full responsibility for securing the peace back in 1920 after the first World War.  The American people didn't listen to Wilson in those days.  We turned instead to people who led us away from the hard road of international cooperation to the easy  path of isolation.  If we had listened to him we might well have avoided the terrible trial of the second World War, in which 300,000 of our young men died."
7.30907240342699e-05,0.999926909275966,1082_7,0,"And their voting record on farm policy is open for everyone to examine.  It is a record of opposition and harassment for 20 years, not only on price supports, but on all of the other Democratic programs on the storage program, rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, rural electric coops and so on.  The Republican Old Guard has never understood the philosophy behind these programs; it has never understood the programs themselves; it has never understood how they work.  The warning is plain; the Old Guard is hoping that the General can make his easy promises to farmers so convincing that they will forget about their own voting record."

In those days, war traveled no faster than a horse's jog.  I ended my last tour with troops in May of this year.  By then, the pace of war had stepped up to the speed of the jet plane and the impact of the atomic bomb."
6.80282773089409e-05,0.999931971722691,1103_1,0,"My three days have carried me into quite a few corners of our country, so you may be interested in a few observations that I think are accurate. My first two days were spent in six southern cities. I was interested to see what were the subjects that seemed to interest them most, subjects involving national problems and the national scene, and then to compare those with similar reactions in the north. In my opinion they are identical."
7.50892556827806e-05,0.999924910744317,1107_24,0,"Let me tell you plainly what I want to cast away, with the aid of a Republican Congress and Republican officials in the states. First, we shall cast away the incompetent, the unfit, the cronies, and the chiselers.  And it won't take years of Congressional investigation and a lot of tax money to clean out the mess."
0.000245116131819386,0.999754883868181,1114_3,0,"So, in all of our problems of the preservation of Constitutional forms, in the determination that Communism shall not take over our government, in the determination that Communism abroad shall not present to us an unbearable threat, let us remember this:  We are first of all defending the basic tenets of our Constitutional government that each man is a spiritual being created in the image of his God. Once we have gotten that thought in our minds so that we never forget it, ladies and gentlemen, we can clean out corruption.  Why, think of it, think of the votes we can roll up on November 4th.  We can bring down taxes; we can stop the terrific taxes that are piling up your prices.  An economist came into me the other day, one of these fellows, you know, that dig out the facts.  Every time you eat a boiled egg, unless you raise it yourself, you pay 100 taxes on that egg, one hundred taxes and then we wonder where the prices come from."
7.36472578681801e-05,0.999926352742131,1137_6,0,"Much of my life in the service of my country I have been forced to spend abroad.  It does one thing for you, ladies and gentlemen.  It makes certain that every time you come back you think more of this country.  If there is any veteran in this whole crowd who didn't have that same feeling when he came stemming into New York or San Francisco or Seattle or Norfolk, then I would be astonished because I have never yet met one who has not said, Well, one good thing a tour abroad does for you; it makes you understand how well worthwhile it is working here at home."
7.58253986167684e-05,0.999924174601384,1156_13,0,"No one, not even the blindest partisan, can call this a proud record.  At times the pitiless pressure of Communism has been checked by brave emergency attempts that rallied men of all parties to make up the deficiencies in our national leadership.  These attempts have produced the economic help of the Marshall Plan and the program of military aid to Greece and Turkey.  Both were enactments of the Republican 80th Congress, the Congress so long vilified by the administration.  These measures have helped to steady both the economic and the nervous systems of our allies.  They could hardly have been expected to do more in the making of our foreign policy.  Dollars and guns are no substitute for brains and willpower."
7.17814350045644e-05,0.999928218564995,1170_2,0,"Now, that is the kind of recommendation that is easy to carry out.  What I am discussing as I go around is the incompetent leadership you have gotten over the past seven years from your administration in Washington.  And I go into the various subjects of our lack of progress toward peace, our excessive expenditures on the federal level, the deficits that are cheapening our money, the crises that are going up, the taxes that grow more and more burdensome; and, with all of the necessary expenditures for defense organisms that we must have, still a kind of incompetence in government that gets two airfields in North Africa for the price of five and the kind of thing going on in the Justice Department that led an ex-under secretary, a high official in the Justice Department, to say only yesterday, Why, if my ex-chief should tell all he knew, they would blow the White House so high that the power of gravity could not bring it back."
7.70134340546071e-05,0.999922986565945,1188_9,0,"I do not propose to talk tonight as if the American people had not lived through a great depression.  Its causes were many, and its costs in human distress were terrible. It is our pledge that the full power of government and every national resource will be devoted to seeing that it shall never again happen in America."
7.52189373497291e-05,0.99992478106265,1197_11,0,"There are a lot of other parts to this verbal barrage.  For example, the Republicans are accused of attempting to abolish social security.  Sheer bunk!  What the Republicans have said is this:  our purpose is to keep the dollar from going down further so that there will be no further erosion of your savings account, of your bank account, of your insurance policy and of your bonds.  But instead of seeing those things go down the drain of inflation you will keep them, and moreover they have said that where inflation has already overtaken some of these things, these amounts, and they have gone down below decency, that must be corrected, which means corrected upward.  They have also pledged in their platform to expand social security to go to classes not so far covered."
7.00696407500812e-05,0.99992993035925,1210_2,0,"First of all, of course, corruption is an expense piled onto all of the necessary expenditures that you people must bear.  By this I mean the actual cost in dollars is something that you have to add onto all these wasteful and extravagant expenses, as well as the necessary expenses.  But the great damage done to us by corruption in government is, after all, not just the few dollars it takes out of our tax revenues and our pockets.  This mess in Washington lowers our prestige abroad and robs us of pride in our own government.  If we are going to restore pride in government, who is going to do it?  You can't take an organization that has been in power far too long and merely by doing a little face-lifting job, doing a little repaint job, get by with it.  Actually, I believe that the administration candidate said all it needed was a little refreshening.  But as far as I am concerned, how do you refreshen a bad egg?"

0.000178925997429761,0.99982107400257,1238_22,0,"The Achilles heel of any nation is spiritual poverty.  Aggressive nations seek out such weakness in the same way a bully seeks out a weakling for his attack.  There are national bullies yet in this world, ready to seize upon signs of weakness in our American spirit--our faith, our confidence, our determination."
7.70359834587973e-05,0.999922964016541,1241_7,0,"They fear, they say, that a new administration, not of the Fair Deal type, would take away all our social security programs.  Again, what rot!  All of us have gone up and down the country pledging not only the extension of those programs, but their correction, to make good the losses you have already suffered through inflation--in your bonds, in your savings accounts and in your pensions--and above all, to save whatever value still remains in the dollar.  At least, let's not let it go down from a present worth of 52 cents until it would be worth only twenty-five cents or less."

This is the faith--not in the fiction of the abstract common man, but in the wondrous fact that every man is an uncommon man.  He is the infinitely precious, utterly unique individual of living flesh, whose spirit has such strength that he can endure and survive oppression and poverty, disease and imprisonment, to keep alive his soul's love of freedom."
7.70679458740652e-05,0.999922932054126,1266_7,0,"But finally and more important than that, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few weeks I have gone up and down the length of this land.  I have promised farmers that when they have problems, bring those problems to Washington.  If the United States chooses to place on me and my associates in this crusade the responsibility for conducting the national governmental affairs during the next four years, each of these problems will be solved only after complete consultation with the people affected.  I have made that promise and that pledge to farmers.  I have pledged that to labor.  On Labor Day I said, The pledge that this crusade makes you is this:  We would be firm, we would be just, we would be fair, but we will be friendly.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is what I should say that a new administration could do instantly on this problem.  Not only could they bring in advice, general advisors and consultants on the whole problem of promotion of small industries throughout our country, but they could bring in specifically, from this area people of management and business and investment and labor, the men who are working and out of work, bring them in and say, Let us find out what we can do here, what can the federal government do legitimately without interfering with your lives, but in a friendly, helpful sort of way that will both to the benefit of the federal government and to this city."
7.08843191608311e-05,0.999929115680839,1280_3,0,"We have got to get dedicated men and women from all over this United States who have been living closer to the people, who have not grown arrogant by being too long in power, who have not gotten too complacent or indifferent or think they can sell any bill of goods of fear and despair to America and so secure its votes. Now, if we are going to have a fresh start on this thing, we have got to have a complete change in the political complexion in Washington.  I picked up this morning a little clipping.  I am going to read to you just two sentences:  In South Bend, Indiana, yesterday, someone from the crowd addressed by the Democratic candidate, the administration's hand-picked candidate, shouted this question, Would you fire Acheson?   And it says here, Dean Acheson, the Secretary of State, and the answer was this, I will answer questions like that after the election, the Governor replied.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is the only answer the poor man could make.  He has the record, this sorry record of the last seven years to defend, and here is one he can't defend; but he can't on the other hand, say in advance, I repudiate that record and the people who have made it.  But I say, this crusade in which I am engaged does repudiate that record of error, and we are ready to replace from top to bottom.  No one has anything but admiration for the great body of public servants of America who are contained in the civil service and in the uniformed services.  We are talking, in this top to bottom clean-out, about these political appointees, the policy-makers, if you please, of our country--and not only in domestic policy but in this foreign field."

7.42437739470928e-05,0.999925756226053,1300_38,0,"A: You know, fortunately, Mr. Nagel, this morning there was a very significant item in the paper. It was this: There was quoted a top-secret document of the American Defense Department. How it got there, we will never know probably. But that top-secret document brought out one fact that really answers your question. It was this. There was a military estimate made in September 1947 by military men, and it had this conclusion: The military occupation of South Korea is not essential to the military security of the United States of America."

Let's hear briefly from each of these Western governors.  First, the able chief executive of Arizona, my very good friend, Governor Howard Pyle."

My friend Chris Herter has broad experience and a warm concern for people which fit him to be a great governor of your great state. I stand before you, tonight, in the solemn knowledge that--by this hour of the morrow--you may have summoned me to serve as president of the United States."

We can preserve the position of the small business without injury to the large. We can strengthen labor unions and collective bargaining as vital institutions in a free economy. We can and our party history proves that we will!"
8.5468504565296e-05,0.999914531495435,1322_4,0,"I want to pay tribute, on the Labor Day, to the magnificent role that American labor, under the leadership of the AFL-CIO, has played in the world wide struggle with Communism. No agency, public or private, has been more effective in arousing the hearts and minds of the plain people of the Free World to an awareness of the menace. By its leadership in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, American labor has welded the free trade unions of every nation into a solid front against Communism."
8.17757916169039e-05,0.999918224208383,1328_16,0,Their technique has been ingenious and ruthless. They have done on the infighting what they couldn't do in the open. They say they believe in public housing! But they put a declared enemy of public housing in charge of the public housing program.
7.27392053916192e-05,0.999927260794609,1335_23,0,"The Republican congressman from this very district, Mr. Hyde, said of the classroom problem, There is not a state in this Union which cannot afford to take care of that need. Another Republican congressman suggested that classes were too small and that they should go into the evening and run twelve months of the year. And, though President Eisenhower was nominally in favor of aid to education, this particular congressman on April 12, 1956, read into the Record a letter from the President in which Mr. Eisenhower said, I would flatly oppose any grant by the federal government to all states in the Union for educational purposes. I am perplexed to say the least, but contradiction--unilateral as well as multilateral--seems to be about the only entertainment these Republicans have contrived."

The projects that have been built are monuments to the hard and persistent work of your representatives in Congress, of men like John McClellan and Bill Fulbright and the members of your House delegation. But they have succeeded only when the climate was right--that is, when your senators and congressmen had the sympathetic support of a Democratic administration instead of determined Republican opposition."
7.05873525776603e-05,0.999929412647423,1343_6,0,"Four years ago, the voters could reasonably believe that Mr. Eisenhower's personal crusade would alter traditional Republican policies and, indeed, remake the Republican party in his own image. Today, the record makes it clear that this has not been done--and circumstances make it certain that it will not be done in the four years ahead. It was not, as some sought to suggest, the habit of the past that sustained your faith in the Democratic party in 1952. It was rather your vision of the future. It is true that Southerners have long memories, and many bitter things to remember. But it is also true that the South is caught up today in a rushing pattern of change that makes this in many ways the most exciting and the most promising region in our country."

I remind him that his Secretary of Defense talked about workers out of jobs as kennel or hunting dogs, and that it was a White House assistant who said of unemployment this spring that the right to suffer is one of the joys of a free economy. And I want to say something, too, about another kind of indifference. I mean about the crisis in education in this country. The President said last night that twice in his State of the Union messages--in 1955 and 1956--he urged swift action--and that he even called a conference on education."

The Eisenhower administration seems to have confused genuine friendship for business with snuggling intimacy toward a few of its giants. And meanwhile the big have gotten bigger and the small are disappearing."

If that means anything, it means they should get parity without price supports. And if that is what Mr. Eisenhower meant, why didn't he say so four years ago? He didn't say so because he knew that any such statement would have cost him."

Every consideration--the President's age, his constitutional position under the Twenty-second amendment--makes it inevitable that the dominant figure in the Republican party under a second Eisenhower term would be Richard Nixon.

The project itself is a good example of one phase of the partnership principle which this administration believes in as applying to the conservation of resources.  It happens to be one of those that is too far-reaching in its effect, too gigantic in size, to be handled by local authorities and local resources.  And so the government gladly steps in, glad to do it."

This train is headed not only south, but it is headed toward Washington.  I think in many ways the election of 1960 comes at a time more dangerous for our country, more trying for all of us, a period of greater responsibility for every citizen than any election since the election of 1860.  In that time, as you recall, the great issue was whether this country could stay united, whether it would, in the words of Lincoln, exist half slave and half free.  The issue in the election of 1960 involves not only the well-being of the people of this valley, involves not only the development of your natural resources, but as citizens of the United States and leaders of the free world, we must be concerned about such far-off places as the Congo, India, and Indonesia, the security of those countries, as well as the well-being of their people."

We cannot be bound by the last eight years. We cannot be committed by a party of the past. We cannot wait for Mr. Khrushchev's words, for the Communists are not satisfied with their gains of the last months, with their lead in missiles and space, and their foothold in Cuba, and half of Indochina, and their new influence in Laos and Africa and Asia. They will keep on driving and expanding and gaining without regard to all the kitchen debates and without regard to what goes on in the United Nations unless we have a president and a country in the 1960s that acts first and acts fast."

Mr. Nixon said later this week that that statement was false.  He boasts of tremendous power development during the past eight years, and he asserted that the Russians can overtake us only if we did nothing for fifteen years, while they built eight Grand Coulee Dams a year.  That is his charge and what are the facts?  The facts were reported last year by a committee of the U.S. Senate, over which Mr. Nixon occasionally presides.

There are 15 million American homes, according to the last Bureau of the Census, which are substandard.  Mr. Nixon has issued a paper on housing, and this, I think, is most revealing of all and one of the most endearing qualities of the Vice President.  In his position paper issued in New York within the last three weeks, he says that the Housing Act of 1949 has worked very well, and do you know as a congressman he voted against it?  In that position paper he called for greater emphasis on middle-income housing and he voted against that in 1950.  He calls for a greater flow of housing credit so that the American people can buy houses at low rates of interest.  But he neglects to mention his vote as vice president to increase the interest rates on the GI housing bans.  High interest rates never built a single home and one of the reasons why we are building 200,000 less homes each year than we should to keep up with our population increase is because of the high interest rate policy of this administration."

But what is the area of difference between us?  What is the issue on which you should base your decision?  You should not only make a judgment of Mr. Nixon and myself.  You should also make a judgment about yourselves, what you want, about what your view is of your country and your community, about what your view of the future is, whether you are satisfied today or wish to do better.  If you are satisfied, if you feel happy about your life, if you feel our country is meeting its responsibilities, then you belong in Mr. Nixon's camp.  But if you share the view that I hold very vigorously that this country is going to have to do better in the future, that we have responsibilities to meet not only to ourselves but to the cause of freedom, that we are anxious to make sure that in the future people decide that these days were great days in the life of our country, that we must move forward, we must stimulate our growth, we must hold out an image to the world of a vigorous, dynamic society, if we are going to continue to lead the free world--I believe that is the choice.

Why do I set that particular standard?

I could tell you that the way to get it is just to leave it to Washington, that Washington is going to provide the jobs and the schools and the progress we need, but that isn't the way it work in this country of ours.  The way to progress in America is not through putting the responsibility on the federal government, but for the federal government to adopt policies that will stimulate the incentive and the creative ability of 180 million free Americans, just such as you here."

And so I say to you today that the most important responsibility of the next president is to keep the peace without surrender and that is the question you should ask--which of the candidates--which of the two for president and vice president will best provide that leadership.

They are not like the people you and I know in this country.  They have an entirely different set of values.  They are people who are determined to conquer the world and they will follow no rules of the game whatever, and this means, in other words, that we need, in order to deal with them, to develop the strength, we need to have the realism, which will effectively stop their plans and stop them without war."

And that's the way to get it, and not through just sending it down to Washington to create the jobs through what Washington spends. There was another point that I would make.  I make it here recognizing that most of the people in this great audience are those that have had rare opportunities.  You have had the chance to go up in your communities, to go to school.  You have not suffered from discrimination or prejudice, the great majority of you.  And the reason I mention it to you, the reason that I think it's particularly appropriate to say it here is because I don't know of any man in this country who at the state level, and who also in his life, has done a more effective job, or one who has believed more deeply than Governor Nelson Rockefeller in the field of creating equal opportunities for all of our people.

We must widen opportunities for all.  We must improve the quality of educational effort.  We must enhance the status of our teachers.  To that end, I have proposed a national program in support of education, emphasizing such elements as college scholarships for those who cannot under any circumstances afford to borrow and to pay back, tax credits or deductions to cover tuition and other costs of higher education, aid in school construction to provide needed facilities, and thereby to release local funds for raising teachers' salaries--all of this, however, particularly at the secondary and primary level, to be accomplished without compromising local controls of our school system."

The Paris conference, you remember, was the one that Mr. Khrushchev broke up.  He said he broke it up at the time because the President had ordered the U-2 flights, you recall, which were ordered to protect the security of the United States, to get information about whether there was a surprise attack being mounted against the United States, and at that time Mr. Khrushchev demanded that the President of the United States apologize or express regrets for those flights.

No, I say, we can have progress and that we will have it, but that the way to get it is not through programs which, in effect, will say, Turn over all these problems to the Federal Government.

Let us at least draw some meaning that is lasting from their martyrdom. As I said here in Los Angeles last night to a large rally in the streets--I have no careful solutions to offer, and nothing that is strikingly new to say. What needs to be said once more all around the world is Let us stop the killing and stop the killing everywhere. Let us stop it here in our own land before we convince our own children that violence is in fact the normal way of life. Let us stop it while we still have the capacity to love one another as human beings--not just the few people right in our neighborhood, our own families and those around us--but people everywhere who, like us, want their years of happiness and life. But if I have anything to say about the course of events in the years ahead, there is one thing, above all else, that I would like to say and do. I would like to make it possible for a child in the Middle East, or anywhere else around this world, to live a full and secure and happy life before that child dies. I want to try to make it possible for that little girl in Vietnam that we saw running into the arms of the camera lens on fire from Napalm to be blessed by the warmth of love rather than the tragedy of war. I want to try and make it possible for people to live as though we really were created in the image of God rather than in the image of our worst fears and suspicions of each other. So I say Peace--not just now, but peace always. I say Peace--not just in one land, but in every land where there are men and women and children who don't know what it is to see a sunrise or to see trees in the springtime. I see and say Peace--on a planet which gives us life, among people who have no right to take it away from others. And I ask, as I did last night, that you say with me, in the words of that great prayer of St. Francis of Assisi, Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love. And then we will reap all of the blessings that we, and the generations before us, had hoped for, and our children will bless us because we have given them the fullness of life.

And just coincidentally the antitrust action was dropped. I can't believe that it was a coincidence.

Those who let their politics impeach their honesty tell you that inflation is the product of governmental waste and mismanagement. Whether this is legitimate politics I shall not presume to say.

It's like a husband coming into the kitchen, seeing one potato peeling that is too thick, and exploding that now he knows why you can't make ends meet. I'm for the government's peeling its potatoes with a sharp knife and a miserly eye. And I've done some sharp and miserly peeling in Illinois myself.

We are not making the promises that the Republicans are, and we don't play politics with promises we know we cannot keep. We are trying to talk straight to the American people. We are recognizing that the course ahead of us is a stern course; that there are no easy, cheap solutions for Communism, for want, for hunger, for all of the miseries that torment our world.

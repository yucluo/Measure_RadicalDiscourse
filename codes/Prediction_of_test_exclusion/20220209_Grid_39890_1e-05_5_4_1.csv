I ask you: to whom should our people entrust the fight against Communism--to those Old Guard Republicans who, on one issue after another, vote the way our enemies like to see them vote? Or to those who have rallied the free world against Communist aggression?"

It is a record of opposition and harassment for 20 years, not only on price supports, but on all of the other Democratic programs on the storage program, rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, rural electric coops and so on.  The Republican Old Guard has never understood the philosophy behind these programs; it has never understood the programs themselves; it has never understood how they work.  The warning is plain; the Old Guard is hoping that the General can make his easy promises to farmers so convincing that they will forget about their own voting record."

My first two days were spent in six southern cities.

Once we have gotten that thought in our minds so that we never forget it, ladies and gentlemen, we can clean out corruption.  Why, think of it, think of the votes we can roll up on November 4th.  We can bring down taxes; we can stop the terrific taxes that are piling up your prices.  An economist came into me the other day, one of these fellows, you know, that dig out the facts.  Every time you eat a boiled egg, unless you raise it yourself, you pay 100 taxes on that egg, one hundred taxes and then we wonder where the prices come from."

I was told that the last stop at Grand Rapids, Now, this is where you say goodbye to Michigan.  And then as we came along, a couple of your finest salesmen from Kalamazoo said, We are going to slow up the train as you go through Kalamazoo and you wave at some people.  Then later they said, Now, we'll tell you what we want to do.  We'll stop there a second and you just go on out and say hello and go on with your work.

Well, some things are so false you don't know the right words to use, at least in polite society, for condemning them.  I went to Kasson and on behalf of Republican leaders, and with the concurrence of the great men of the party, at least all that could be reached in time, I stated exactly what we meant to do, and the present 90 percent parity price in the farm program was sustained and supported completely.  Moreover, we pledge that these programs in the future, as it comes time for them to be revised and brought up to date as all programs must be, it will be farmers that will be brought in to Washington whose counsel and advice will not only be sought but, it will be heed."

It is in the record as to what the Republican Party expects to do, purposes to do, with price supports, with REA, with cooperatives, with all of those things that mean so much to farm life today.  And that means perishable products as well as nonperishables.  So all of this talk about the Republican Party trying to put the farmer in the poor house is about as weak an argument as they could develop.  They say we want to abolish good times, that everybody will be out with a tin cup on the bread lines.  I made a talk the other night at Peoria where I took to pieces this so-called Democrat prosperity to show that the only advance in living standards the American people have made in the last 20 years was during the five years of World War II.  I do not believe that America wants a prosperity that is based upon the risks and sacrifices that men have to make in uniform against an enemy."

We will do them ladies and gentlemen only if we are a united people, united behind the great aspirations and purposes of our government.  And right there is the crux of the matter.  You must have a government that you trust, respect and believe in, if you are going to have a united United States.  A united United States would be a strong bulwark of peace.  A united strong United States can lead the free nations of the world into that kind of collective security program that will lift a great burden from our hearts:  the burden of fear abroad."

Now, if we are going to have a fresh start on this thing, we have got to have a complete change in the political complexion in Washington.  I picked up this morning a little clipping.  I am going to read to you just two sentences:  In South Bend, Indiana, yesterday, someone from the crowd addressed by the Democratic candidate, the administration's hand-picked candidate, shouted this question, Would you fire Acheson?   And it says here, Dean Acheson, the Secretary of State, and the answer was this, I will answer questions like that after the election, the Governor replied.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is the only answer the poor man could make.  He has the record, this sorry record of the last seven years to defend, and here is one he can't defend; but he can't on the other hand, say in advance, I repudiate that record and the people who have made it.  But I say, this crusade in which I am engaged does repudiate that record of error, and we are ready to replace from top to bottom.  No one has anything but admiration for the great body of public servants of America who are contained in the civil service and in the uniformed services.  We are talking, in this top to bottom clean-out, about these political appointees, the policy-makers, if you please, of our country--and not only in domestic policy but in this foreign field."

We could make some allowance for them if they had the honesty or the common sense, or both, to admit that they had been deceived and to show a stern purpose of preventing similar subversion in the future. There has been considerable concern--and rightfully so--about methods to be used in rooting Communism out of our government."

America, which has lifted man to his highest economic state, which has saved freedom in war and peace, which saved collective security, no longer sparks and flames and gives off new ideas and initiatives.

He has not hesitated to endorse any Republican, be he a Taft Republican or a McCarthy Republican.

What I want to do today is to talk over with you some of my views based on this serious study. At the outset I would like this point clearly understood: the problems of farm people ought not be approached, as far too often has been the case in the past, as something to exploit for political advantage.

I think we must emphasize the things that unite America.  I pointed out in speaking to a great labor organization yesterday the fact that Mr. Kennedy had been in Detroit and made the statement that he was for everything union leaders were for, in effect, and that he opposed everything that they were against.  And I said to this group, Look, I'm for many of the things your leaders are for, but I'm not for all the things and I will not make a commitment that I'm for all the things that the leaders of unions or management or farm organizations or any other part or group of America are for, because a president must be president of all America and not just part of America."

I'll tell you why.  Because we know him.  We know the Communists.  We sat opposite the table with them.  We know what they're trying to do.  Here are fanatical, ruthless men who are determined to conquer the world, determined to conquer it by any means, if necessary.  But when we consider them, then, we've got to recognize that they're going to cause us trouble--they're going to cause us trouble every time they can.

We have sat down across the conference table with him.  We know that he is a man who is ruthless and tough.  We know that you must never make him a concession unless you get a concession in return.  That's why President Eisenhower was right in not doing what Mr. Khrushchev asked him to do again in the paper this morning, in not apologizing and not expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev as Senator Kennedy suggested he might.  That is why the next president of the United States must recognize that Mr. Khrushchev does not react like Mr. Nehru, he isn't like Mr. Adenauer, or Mr. Macmillan.  He is a man determined to conquer the world and so, first, we will keep America strong--the strongest in the world.  Second, we will see that the economy of this country moves forward so that Mr. Khrushchev never will be able to get through on his boast that he is going to catch us.

We have a great humanitarian concern, and one of the reasons that we have developed this concern is because of the contribution made by people that make up the mainstream of American life.

Such efforts toward personal security, first, are right--not only from the humanitarian viewpoint, which all of us will understand--they are mandatory if our complex modern society is to work at its best, at its fullest.  They are essential to our purpose.  And what is that purpose?  I think, summed up in a sentence, it is this: we must lift the ceiling over personal opportunity.  We must strengthen the floor over the pit of personal disaster.  Public policy, therefore, should seek to put right what is wrong in our America, but it should also seek to strengthen what is right.  It should recognize the plain fact that Americans are proud and self-reliant individuals.

Well, we only had to wait twenty-four hours to find out what that was.

It's--again, it's your money. We ought to stop some of the regulation. We ought to review some of the regulation.

Those who let their politics impeach their honesty tell you that inflation is the product of governmental waste and mismanagement. Whether this is legitimate politics I shall not presume to say. But as an explanation of the causes of inflation, it is pure poppycock. It's like a husband coming into the kitchen, seeing one potato peeling that is too thick, and exploding that now he knows why you can't make ends meet. I'm for the government's peeling its potatoes with a sharp knife and a miserly eye. And I've done some sharp and miserly peeling in Illinois myself.

We must continue to meet the present urgent needs of the people. Too many Americans today dwell in misery in tenements in our huge congested cities--second-class citizens living in third class houses. Too many Americans still live in rags in sharecroppers' shacks. Too many Americans find that rising living costs are outrunning their pensions, social security benefits, life insurance proceeds and their salaries. The cost of living and wages have been chasing each other up and up in a dizzy, dangerous spiral of inflation that spells disaster for everyone. And we know what to do about that too, if the Republicans will just keep their hands off."

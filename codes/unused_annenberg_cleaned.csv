We do come before you with this pledge:  if you want to send this great group of Republicans in the Senate, in the Congress and in the executive department, to Washington, they pledge that every policy that they consider, everything they take up, will be decided on one yardstick and that yardstick will be what is good for the United States as a whole.  They are not going to talk in terms of sectionalism or of class or of group.  What is good for 155 million Americans--that will be the criterion by which they will measure every one of their actions.

This is the thing that keeps me going night and day and I know--I don't have to be told--that we are the underdog in this campaign, but remember that was the same thing that was said about John Kennedy in 1960, it was the same thing that was said about Harry Truman in 1948, and it is the same thing that has been said about other people who have undertaken this race for the presidency of the United States. And if you stand with us and persevere and don't pay too much attention to these public opinion polls, I have no doubt that when the votes are counted on November 7th, Ohio will be in the Democratic column. And if we win Ohio, we are going to win the nation and we are going to make America once again the great and good land that it ought to be. ",1094,998

All these are important issues, but I must say what is most important is that the United States recognize in the 1960s that these are difficult and dangerous times, that it is going to require the best of all of us, whether we live in Massachusetts or whether we live in South Carolina.  I do not go to the American people--and it is upon your shoulders that the great decision will rest--promising that if I am elected life will be easy.  I think to be a citizen of the United States in the 1960s is going to be a burdensome and hazardous occupation.  But I have the greatest confidence in this country.  I have the greatest confidence in our system of government.  I know we can meet our responsibilities.  And I do not agree with those who say that we downgrade the United States when we downgrade Republican leadership.  I am not satisfied, in our most dangerous years, to have our steel mills working 50 percent, to have 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls never get to college, to be turning out half as many doctors and nurses as we now need, to find the largest agricultural surplus, $9 billion, stored away rotting while more than 5 million Americans go to bed every night on a substandard diet of 5 cents a day of surplus foods.

Our generation of Americans must meet its responsibility, not only to ourselves, but to all those who wish to trod on freedom's road.  I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans has taken over in this country, men who fought in Italy and the South Pacific in order to maintain this country's freedom, men who have the greatest confidence in our country, men who want to see it move again, men who want to set it going again.  And I come to South Carolina and ask your help in this campaign.  I ask you to join us in building a stronger America, an America which will serve as an example to a watching world as we sit on a most conspicuous stage.

Of course, we have our moments of success.  When we won World War II we thought we were embarked upon a great and peaceful era.  But we did win the war.

Let us get a government behind which we can unite, which can arouse the best in us, which will be honest with us, which will not try to conceal mistakes, and which will give us a chance to make America and the world what it can be.  America can be a safe, secure place for us.  It can be a leader toward peace and decency in the world.  And that is exactly what her destiny is, exactly the destiny that her people can achieve.

They merely lead in accordance with constitutional processes of our country, the energy, the thoughts, the spirit, the product of 155 million people.  Consequently, unless they have that faith, they are helpless.  Now, your problem is to decide between now and November 4 what is the best way for you to get that kind of government--one that will inspire your faith, one in which you will believe, one in which your aspirations and your hopes, if they cannot be reached, at least progress will be made toward them.  More than that, no one can pledge you that they will try with all of the wisdom and justice and spirit of fair-play with which God endowed them, with a determination to be honest, square-shooting and straightforward, to lead the American people as well as they may in the paths of peace abroad and prosperity, happiness and tranquillity at home.",1180,998

I do so wherever and whenever I meet them.  I believe in you; the Republican Party believes in you, if you will allow me to be just a bit partisan in front of this kind of an audience.

I owe it to them, as I told them during the war, ""You are going home to a country that's free.  You are going home to a country that's the greatest place on earth.""

Our interest in the Middle East is to turn back the age-old forces of hunger and poverty, disease and despair. We should not use great economic projects such as the Aswan High Dam as mere pawns in a diplomatic cat-and-mouse game. Such projects should be considered soberly on their merits and in terms of our own and the other country's national interest. We should make it unmistakably clear to the Arab governments that we stand ready to assist their peaceful economic development just as we are determined to deny the fruits of aggression. The same is true with regard to Israel which needs help to care for the 50,000 new immigrants who arrive each year and to develop the bases of its economy.

These are the great ideals that America stands for.  And it is these ideals that will win this struggle for peace and freedom.

I have been to Vietnam on several occasions and have spent most of the time talking to the American GIs who are stationed there, and I know that a sizable percentage of them are sick at heart over what they are asked to do. But does it make our honor any less questionable that we have reduced the number of American casualties while we have increased the number of bodies dying under this murderous artillery and aerial bombardment. I ask if we are more honorable because the color of the bodies has changed from white to yellow. I think not, for the blood is still red, and the pain is still as great. I think not, because when we think of the people of Indochina, we have to know, in our more thoughtful moments, that they too are created in the image of God.

But there is one thing I do believe that the American people have in common. I think they want very much to love this country. They want to be proud of it, they want it to stand for the ideals that gave us birth some 200 years ago--ideals that we are going to commemorate in this very city, especially in 1976.

2226,"A: I think that if we will end the war in Southeast Asia that set off these inflationary pressures in the first place much of the reason for wage-price controls will disappear. But in any event let us assume that this doesn't happen. Let us assume that these inflationary pressures continue. I want an evenhanded policy that doesn't make labor the goat of these wage-price controls. It is just a fact of life today that the wage-price controls are working pretty well in regulating the wages of working people. They are not working in controlling prices. Prices have gone up another eighteen points during the time that Mr. Nixon has been in the White House. The price of everything we buy continues to rise, and if we are going to continue to have wage-price controls I would at least make you a commitment that they would be administered in an evenhanded way, so that we don't have a five and a half percent lid on the income of working people and then permit the salaries and the profits of corporate executives to skyrocket in some cases as much as 100 percent.

2219,"I have people ask me, from time to time, if I don't get discouraged about the public opinion polls and about the obvious advantage that the Republicans have over us in this election. And the answer is of course, anybody has moments when he is discouraged in an uphill fight of this kind. And I know it is uphill. I know we are short on money. I know we have made some mistakes. But I want everyone here to know that I have been in politics almost twenty years and there was never one moment, in all that twenty years, when I didn't have to fight uphill for every victory that I have ever scored. So whenever I get a little bit discouraged, I think of those young men of ours out in Vietnam who have sat in their cells in Hanoi for six or seven years. And I think about that little Vietnamese girl that I saw burning with napalm running right into the camera lens. And that picture ought to be on the conscience of every man and woman and every boy and girl in this land. So when I think of that, we don't have time to be discouraged. We don't have time to look back and we don't have time for four more years of that kind of senseless destruction and death. I think of men and women who are without jobs and I see it on the faces of people in all parts of this country who want to work--some are trained engineers and scientists and they can't get work. Then I think--we can't stand four more years of that kind of unemployment in this country. I think of young children right here in Illinois suffering from hunger, and young GI's coming back from Vietnam, some of them hopelessly hooked on heroin, and I think of young mothers who can't pay their grocery bills. And we can't stand four more years of that. I think of the wiretappers and the war mongers and discrimination. And I know we can't take four more years of that. I think of millions of these older people living out their lives in loneliness, many of them at the poverty level or below; the education bill; the child development bill and some of the health bills. And I know we can't take four more years of that. I don't think we can take four more years of the harassment by this administration of the free press in this country. I do not think that we can take four more years of the leadership that has no real vision of the greatness of America, because it is still true that where there is no vision that people perish. And I have been with the people of this country and I say to you--let us not be discouraged tonight. Like Franklin Roosevelt, I love a good fight. My spirit is high and in the words of the song--let us think about the great unfinished business of this country and let us grow on the great historic, spiritual, moral and sources of the strength of this nation and remember that old hymn of the faith that goes back to the days of the black slaves when they sang, ""Sometimes I feel like a motherless chile.""",2893,998

William Pitt, the Prime Minister, was toasted at that dinner as the savior of Europe. He rose to his feet, he answered the toast.

It is a goal that has defied our efforts from the dawn of time. It has never been attained in human history, but it is the only worthy goal--and, it is the goal, if I may say so, of the Democratic party, because the Democratic party believes in peace; it believes in mankind; it believes in you and me; it believes that we were made in the image of God.

In 1860, when he was an old, old man he was invited to come to Springfield to the annual convention of the Democratic party and to make a little speech. He spoke, I think, for about two hours and forty minutes. And when he concluded, he concluded with some words like these, that have always amused me, and I think will amuse you: He said, ""My friends, for forty long years I have carried the Word of God; I have preached the Gospel at the remotest cabin on the frontier; I have traversed these endless forests and these trackless prairies; ten thousand nights I have slept upon the grass with nothing over my head but the sky.

And I'd like to conclude my remarks just by quoting him, because the message that he gave to you is the one I'd like to give to you today. Robert Kennedy's words: ""I ask you to recognize the hard and the difficult road to a better America. I ask you to vote for yourselves. The people must decide this election. For your sake and for the sake of your children, vote, vote for yourselves. Vote for yourselves.""",743,998

2194,"And now, if I could conclude with one very personal note, that would only be appropriate in this city. My father, as you know, was born on a little farm in Ohio, in Vinton County. And he came to this city of Columbus as a teenager and later in his early twenties and he was a motorman on the old streetcar line that they used to have in Columbus. They are gone now. And after he was on the streetcar for a few years, he went to California where he met my mother who was born in Indiana. They were married, and when they were there they raised a family, five boys. There was a lot of sickness in that family, two boys died with tuberculosis. My father also and my mother in their late years were ill. But I remember my father's attitude about America. I think it's yours, and it's certainly mine. He was not a rich man, he was not a man that somebody would call a big man, but he was a very proud man, proud of this country, proud of his Ohio roots, proud of the dignity which he had earned. And my father always used to talk not about his difficult past, because his mother died when he was in the sixth grade, and he had to quit school and go to work, but he always used to tell us, the boys, that in America what we all lived for was to develop in this country a better life for our children than we had for ourselves. That's the American dream. That is what my public life has been dedicated to. And I tell you today, as I stand here in Columbus, here breathing the same air that my father so many years ago was able to breathe, I realize the heritage that I have, I am proud of it, I hope I'm worthy of it, and I pledge to you that the new generation, if I can have this opportunity to serve, I trust, will not have to fight three wars as did my generation; that the new generation will not have to go through a period of rising crime, as has mine; that the new generation will have opportunities such as mine never dreamed of.

I don't go around the country criticizing present leadership because I enjoy it. I admire the President of the United States as a man, but I do not believe that we can continue the same kind of leadership in the future. A Gallup poll taken in ten countries a few months ago asked the people of those countries who they thought would be first in 1970, militarily and scientifically, the Russians or the United States. Now, if you had asked them ten years ago, every one of them would have said the United States. But in 1970, a majority of the people of those countries thought that the Russians would be first, both militarily and scientifically. That is what hurts the United States. If they think we are on the decline and the Russians are on the rise, if they think that our brightest day is somewhere in the past and now the future belongs to the Soviets, then all those people who want to go with the winner turn against us and move in the direction of Moscow and Peking. I want it said in 1970 that we are first, scientifically and militarily, educationally, economically. We should be first because we represent the greatest system of government ever devised.

And I ask everyone here to think about anxious men and women, some six million of them, who cannot find jobs and I ask you if we want four more years of that. And at a time when the cost of everything we buy in the grocery stores continues to go up under Mr. Nixon's so-called wage and price controls, do you really want four more years of holding down the income of workmen while the cost of everything else skyrockets through the roof? And then I ask every American to think about the meaning of agents of the Committee to Re-Elect the President to be caught wiretapping our Democratic National Headquarters at the Watergate, and I ask you if we really want four more years of that. Is it possible that Watergate may be Waterloo for Mr. Nixon?",990,998

And that begins by recognizing that the time is long, long overdue to put an end to the killing and dying and destruction now going on in Southeast Asia. Let us remember what Mr. Nixon said four years ago: those who have had a chance for four years and could not produce peace should not be given another chance; and I agree with that. So we will end the war, and end it fast, and bring our troops and our prisoners home, and then we will get on with the real business of this country. At the top of the list is to provide a decent job for every man and woman in this country who is able to work. And then we will address those loopholes in our tax laws that provide a burden on the backs of the middle and low income people of this country. We will recover some $22 billion now going through the loopholes and this is the money that we will use to support our schools and to relieve and reduce the burden of property taxes across this country. That is the way to carry out tax reform--not by Mr. Nixon's national sales tax that he hopes to unveil after the election on November 7th. I think the time has come for all of us in public life to recognize that we can't sustain confidence in our political process if we advocate one course in public while conspiring on another course in secret.

Never have so many people made so many promises with so little to show for it, and it is without any hesitation that I suggest that if you value your future security and well-being, you will keep the Republican party where it has always been for the past twenty years--in the opposition.

More working on the protection of our environment, in recreational services, in city services of all kinds. I saw a statement in the press a year ago in which Mayor Daley said that if they had the budget to do it, the city of Chicago alone needs 80,000 more public service employees.

But real leadership from America can so bind together the free world that we don't have to fear the assault that those other people could launch against us.  Our total strength in the world, in the free world is so great that if we unified behind real, respected leadership, we will have nothing to fear.

1663,"The third area where I believe the national government can play a role is federal aid to education in the areas for school construction and for teachers' salaries.  There are many thousands of teachers who are underpaid.  There are many thousands of teachers with inadequate training.  I want to see the best teachers with the best training, but make sure that they are adequately compensated.  Otherwise, we are not going to get the best talent and our children will suffer.  Any time that a child grows up without the best education, he dooms himself to a life of economic hardship in many ways.  His children's chances are not so good, and it passes on generation after generation.  A good education is the most valuable resource that you can pass on to your children, and I believe it incumbent upon us in the 1960s to make sure that all of us, cooperating in our respective fields, to make sure that we do have a good educational system.  And this is one of the areas where I believe we have disagreed with the Republican leadership and with Mr. Nixon.  He cast the deciding vote, after speaking about the need two weeks before for well-paid teachers, he cast the deciding vote in the U.S. Senate against the bill which would have provided aid for teachers' salaries.",1272,998

And we need a better educated citizenry than any country to maintain a free society.

We're not a melting pot, as has sometimes been described, because a melting pot means that everything blends in together and becomes the same. We're more of a mosaic--a beautiful mosaic--of different kinds of people who have different kinds of background and interests and education and experience and hopes and dreams and aspirations and fears and prejudices, but we also fit together to make a picture of a nation in its finest form, which has been, and can be, an inspiration to all mankind.

This is going to cause us all kinds of trouble in the next ten years. People who used to support us will be neutral. But in the final analysis it is our greatest source of strength. We desire to be independent; so do they. They desire to be independent of us.

We, in other words, fit in with the basic movement of our time. The Communists do not. Therefore, while there are a great many clouds on the horizon, and there are a great many uncertainties about Africa, Latin America, and Asia, and Eastern Europe, I think that we represent the way to the future.

I am confident we are going to be given the opportunity to give this country leadership, and I am confident that this country is going to move again.  ",771,998

2372,"I doubt that any human being has traveled more in the last two years throughout our great country than have I. I've been in private homes, in a living room, with only the three or four people who would come to hear what I had to say. I've been in labor halls where maybe only ten people would show up. I've stood in factory shift lines where nobody knew who I was. I've walked the streets, gone in beauty parlors, barbershops, and restaurants and stood at the swing doors in shopping centers. I've been in farmers' markets and I've also been in livestock sale barns, to listen, mostly and to talk a little. And I've learned about our country. In the last two weeks, since I began my general election campaign, I've been in many of the ethnic neighborhoods of our nation. And I've seen there the truths that we should never forget.

We've come here to learn, to grow, to stretch our minds, to learn more about God's land, and to be able to encompass in our hearts more friends. Our country gives us room to expand our own lives without constraint. It's been very difficult throughout history to put together two sometimes conflicting principles. One is equality. The other is freedom. Sometimes, when you have guaranteed equality, government must step in and hold down the strong and boost up the weak artificially. When you have complete liberty or freedom, the strong tend to dominate the weak. In our country we've always tried for the last 200 years to do both, to have a melding of liberty and equality on one hand and equality of opportunity on the other. That's what brought my people to this country. That's what brought your people to this country. We came because of hope and a dream of freedom and equality of opportunity.

979,"During the war, you remember, when we all knew America was in danger, we only wanted the best, the most unselfish. We had no time for building political mantraps or for inventing derogatory tales. It was a heart-lifting moment. But a cold war leads the timid and the discontented into frustration. And out of frustration comes pettiness--the niggling, pitiful picture of a confused, divided country which these office-seekers are now painting. And this, of course, was the very purpose for which the Russians invented the cold war and imposed it upon us. They hoped we would feel frustrated, shackled by circumstance. They hoped we would fall to quarreling among ourselves and thus betray our mission. But the American giant will not be shackled! We shall not be tempted by the cold war to be half-regretful, half-ashamed of our strength--or frightened of it, which is worse. Regretful--God help us--in the face of the stirring truth that Lincoln's vision has come true, that now we are indeed the ""last, best hope of earth""--so recognized by all the free world, which implores us to be great, to lead with magnanimity and, above all, with patience. The very powerful, if they are good, must always be patient. And still some of us regret it! Some of us say: ""Why can't life leave us alone? We don't want to lead. We want to be undisturbed."" What would our fathers have said to such talk? From the dawn of our revolution they saw America as the savior--not merely in terms of power, but in terms of goodness. They knew that Providence had given us this empty, unexploited continent for a purpose. And they knew that it must be a purpose which includes all men--for the same God made us all. In 1787 George Washington said: ""The preservation of the sacred fire of liberty, and the destiny of the Republican form of government, are justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finally staked, on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people."" At that time we had less than four million inhabitants. But there was no doubt, no fear, in Washington's mind regarding our destiny. In 1858 Abraham Lincoln said: ""Our reliance is in the love of liberty which God has planted in us. Our defense is in the spirit which prized liberty as the heritage of all men, in all lands everywhere."" At that time there were about thirty million Americans. And we were threatened with civil war. But there was no doubt, no fear, in Lincoln's mind. He saw the war and the dissolution of the Union as a threat to the new, revolutionary idea of the free man and to democratic aspirations everywhere. In 1915 Woodrow Wilson said: ""The interesting and inspiring thought about America is that she asks nothing for herself except what she has a right to ask for humanity itself."" By that time we were a world power, about to enter into a world war. But there was no doubt, no fear, in Woodrow Wilson's mind. He knew, as in truth we have always known, that we were destined to be an example and to assume the burden of greatness. So we are marked men, we Americans at the mid-century point. We have been tapped by fate--for which we should forever give thanks, not laments. What a day to live in! What a flowering of the work and the faith of our fathers! Who in heaven's name would want America less strong, less responsible for the future? And precisely because we are trapped by fate, we must be wise and patient as well as strong. This means that we must live, intensely live, the faith which has made us free and thereby invincible. ""Despotism may govern without faith, but liberty cannot."" American power is not just coal and iron and oil; cotton and wheat and corn. It is not just our forests and our mountain ranges, and the huge meandering rivers of our central plains, and the high dry cattle country, and this lucky land of yours between the mountains and the sea. It is not even all these things plus a hundred and sixty million people. It is these things, plus the people, plus the idea! So a second temptation of the cold frustrating war--which we also proudly reject--is to become so distracted by our troubles that we take this faith too much for granted, that we salute it--as some of us salute our religion--and then go our own way unchanged. If we do not make it part of us--keep it forever before us, intense and demanding and clear--the faith might die and we should then die with it. What is this ""American idea"" which we so justly venerate? I suggest that the heart of it is the simple but challenging statement that no government may interfere with our conscience, may tell us what to think. All our freedoms, all our dynamic unleashed energies, stem from this. We Americans just naturally talk like this: ""No government can tell me what to think. No government can tell me what to do, unless it can prove that the common good is served by such interference."" This is the American way of living. Yet the same Republicans--the dinosaur wing of that party--who object to service from our government--who call everything ""creeping socialism,"" who talk darkly of ""dictatorship""--these same men begin to hint that we are ""subversive,"" or at best the tools of our country's enemies, when we boast of the great strides toward social justice and security we have already made, and of the still greater strides we plan. They laugh at us, superciliously, when we say we are the political party with a heart. To honor and uphold our faith, therefore, we must never let them confuse us about the difference between what government should do, if possible, and what it must never do if America is to survive. It should strengthen us in our freedom by fostering widespread ownership and as much economic independence as possible. In the towns and counties, in the state capitals and in Washington, that great work goes forward today. But never must government step across the line which separates the promotion of justice and prosperity from the interference with thought, with conscience, with the sacred private life of the mind. If you like, this is the distinction between the things that are God's and the things that are Caesar's. The mind is the expression of the soul, which belongs to God and must be let alone by government. But farm prices, minimum wages, old-age pensions, the regulation of monopoly, the physical safety of society--these things are Caesar's province, wherein the government should do all that is humanly possible. But those among us who would bar us from attempting our economic and social duty are quick with accusations, with defamatory hints and whispering campaigns, when they see a chance to scare or silence those with whom they disagree. Rudely, carelessly they invade the field of conscience, of thought,--the field which belongs to God and not to senators--and not to protect the republic, but to discredit the individual. Let us remember also that the first of the seven deadly sins is spiritual pride: the sin which assures me that I know and you don't, so that I give myself permission to use any dubious or dishonest means to discredit your opinion. Because we have always thought of government as friendly, not as brutal, character assassins and slanderers in the Congress of the United States have a free hand in the methods they use. We never foresaw that the cult of thought control and of the big lie would come to America. So if their conscience permits, they can say almost anything. And if my opponent's conscience permits, he can try to help all of them get re-elected. But will he have strengthened or weakened the American idea? This is no small thing, this remorseless attack upon freedom of conscience, freedom of thought. A few peddlers of hate and fear would be of little consequence if they had not been welcomed as satellites by Senator Taft and included in the leadership of this strange crusade. And none of them would be significant if the General--who was implored to come home by Republican leaders so that they might be quit of Senator Taft--had not yielded to the demands of his beaten foe. But because of that surrender, because of those strange allies in his queer crusade, our role in world history, our faithfulness to the men who made the United States is challenged in this election. Finally, then, let us recall that our basic faith in liberty of conscience has an ancient ancestry. We can trace it back through Christian Europe, and through pagan Rome, back to the Old Testament prophets. It is by no means exclusive with us. It is in fact our bond of unity with all free men. But we are its ordained guardians today. Let us lift up our hearts, therefore--glad of our strength, proud of the task it imposes. So far from being half-defeated, half-divided, half-bankrupt--while we are true to ourselves, we can never be defeated; while we accept the honorable burden of leadership, we can never be divided. And in the name of that burden we shall find the means and the determination to spend in money and in labor and in hard thought whatever is needed to save ourselves and our world.",9047,998

Since the free-land frontier ceased to exist so that the footloose and fancy free could pull up and move to the further range, Americans have been facing the new frontier at home and abroad--and the way we conquer the new frontier is not with ax and saw and gun but through the more difficult task of vision, law and government.",653,998

And the Communists are working in those areas night and day, and so is Castro.  Which side will they choose?  The United States, which has been indifferent to their problem?  Or will they decide to move to the Communists who raise a banner and identify themselves with them?  We are going to have to do much better, and I believe, with a new Democratic administration, committed to progress, committed to justice for our people, committed to the development of their talents, regardless of their race or their creed or their color, we can demonstrate that we are a strong and vital and progressive society.  And we shall show the people in the world to the south of us that we do care, that freedom is the road for them, because what we do they can do, what we do they will do, what we must do they must do.  That is our opportunity on Tuesday.  I am confident that on Tuesday, November 8th, the American people will not take the old, tired, worn-out road, but instead will turn and decide to move forward into the wind, and demonstrate what this country can really do.

I don't agree. Why should we--why should we be behind, and what is more important, why should they think we are behind? I am not satisfied to be second in space, to be second in the position that we hold now in some areas of the world.

And this is why my heart goes out to every family in this land who has lost a precious soldier in this senseless war which should have been ended when Mr. Nixon first came into office on a pledge to end it. As we meet here this afternoon we are still spending $250 million a week killing people and destroying the countryside and the villages of Southeast Asia. I say the time has come, without one more day of delay, for us to stop this waste, to stop this killing and then begin investing that $250 million a week in building up our cities, strengthening our housing, strengthening our transportation and doing those things that will put this country back on the path of peace and justice for all of our people.",1127,998

Mr. Gallup, and I don't always agree with his polls, did take a poll in February of this year. In ten countries scattered around the world, he asked them the single question, ""Do you believe by 1970 the United States or the Soviet Union will be first, militarily and scientifically?"" In every one of those countries a majority of the people thought that the Soviet Union would be first. Why? A country of one-half of our productive power, the most backward country of Europe thirty years ago, and yet the majority of the people around the world think that they will pass us in both of those areas in the next ten years.

And so today, as I ask for your help, I say let us be dissatisfied until we build a great future--not for some Americans but for all Americans.

Let us be dissatisfied until we can look back on poverty and hunger and say, ""we have overcome"".  Let us be dissatisfied until there are jobs for every pair of hands that need work.  Let us be dissatisfied until our youth no longer waste their time on street corners or their minds on drugs.  Let us be dissatisfied until the victims of oppression--from Johannesburg to Warsaw, from Manila to Cambodia--can join us and breathe the sweet air of freedom.  Let us be dissatisfied until our children no longer have the nightmares of nuclear war.  Let us be dissatisfied until we have a just and caring president in the White House, and let us be dissatisfied until justice rolls down like the waters of righteousness, like an ever-flowing stream.

Those men and women, because they are incorruptible, will in turn choose their subordinates from incorruptible men and women, and you will get rid of corruption in government, duplication, extravagance, waste and working one against the other because they will work for one thing--the government and the people of the United States of America and not for their own self-aggrandizement.

1633,"It is a great country, but I believe it must be greater, and it is a powerful country, but I believe it must be more powerful, and I believe that our responsibility in the 1960s is to restore to the world the image of America as a society on the move, a society whose high noon is just ahead, not a society which stands still, which begins to lose its vitality, which begins to lose its image as a moving society, a moving country.",431,998
1633,"So those are the basic matters which separate us, and it is to your good judgment, your sense of responsibility, your concern for your country, your identification with the cause of freedom, that we entrust this decision on November 8th.  I can assure you that if we are successful, we will give leadership to this country and Florida, and the United States will move again.  Thank you. ",387,999

3030,"     For all its complexities, the debate over this treaty comes down to this: It's clear what the benefits of trade are.  It's clear what the hazards of investment across national lines are.  And the issue you have to face is who do you trust to protect our workers, our communities, and our environment.  George Bush, whose administration encourages American corporations to move to other countries with low wages and lax environmental laws and even spend your tax money to finance it?  Or Bill Clinton and Al Gore, who have a long record of fighting for good jobs and a healthy environment?  Do you trust George Bush, who's amassed the worst economic record in 50 years, the first decline in manufacturing, two-thirds of the working people with their wages going down, one in ten Americans on food stamps, quadrupled the debt in the last 12 years with our investment in the future going down and no strategy for the future?  Or a different kind of Democrat who believes we can have both open markets and a strong domestic economy?  ",1035,998
3030,"     In the end--in the end, whether the North American Free Trade Agreement is a good thing for America is not a question of foreign policy.  It is a question of domestic policy.  If we are not strong at home, we will inevitably be weaker abroad.  We have to build a new economy in which incomes and employment are rising and companies are growing, a society in which opportunity is expanding and hope comes alive again.  So I say to you, my fellow Americans, we have to have the courage to change.  And a part of that change should encourage, should involve a closer relationship with Mexico, now under better leadership than ever in my lifetime.  If we have the determination to reject the failed policies and the old labels of the past, if we have the vision to see and work toward a better tomorrow, then we need not fear the future.  If we seize this day and shape this change, we can make our great country what it was meant to be.  Thank you very much.    ",964,999

If you believe I am sincere, then that theory is correct and that with the Republicans I can gather around me in Washington, with a Republican Senate and a Republican House we can do the job that you want done, then you have got the opportunity of registering your decision on November 4th.  That does not make the job complete.  From there on you must continue to help because it is public opinion that keeps the United States in the straight and narrow path and it is public opinion or indifference of public opinion that can let us go astray.",714,998

I forded the rivers in the flood and on the snow and on the ice 10,000 miles. I have lain upon hard ground on the prairie with nothing but a canopy of heaven above us.

We are going to get it from the people who will be willing to help, even though they have many other responsibilities, or we just won't get it. I think that both parties ought to have assistance in presenting their views. Then the American people can make a fair choice. Then there is no inequality in their ability to deliver their message. Then the choice is very fair, and we get democracy at its highest. So I hope that you feel as I feel, that in helping this campaign, but in fulfilling a responsibility which goes with citizenship.

We are going to see to it that every old person in this country, living now, many of them, in loneliness and poverty and neglect--we are going to see that those older years are not times of heartache and loneliness, but that this great country at long last provides a decent and dignified assistance to every old person in this country.",800,998

In World War II, some twenty-seven years ago, I served as the pilot of a B-24 bomber. We were hit one day by a heavy anti-aircraft barrage over a very dangerous target in central Europe, and it appeared for a while that we would not be able to make it back, and the crew was on the verge of bailing out. But we assessed the damage and decided that we could make it back to our base and so I gave this order: ""Resume your stations, we are going to bring this plane home.""

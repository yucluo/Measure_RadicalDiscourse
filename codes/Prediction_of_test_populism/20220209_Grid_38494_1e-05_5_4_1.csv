But I still don't feel that I am wasting my time by coming out here, and I am very grateful to all of you for being here, and to all of these children. I hope you are not cutting school."
9.76793511405005e-05,0.999902320648859,1023_2,0,"My heart is very much in these programs because whenever you travel through this great land of ours, you can't help but see how much these programs have meant to so many people. Above all, our Democratic platform calls for action on the overshadowing problems of war and peace--the most important unfinished business of our generation--and I mean steady resistance to Communism and patient and persistent efforts to build a peace which has been man's dearest goal from time immemorial. Now, in these few words--if these were all that you knew about me and about our Democratic platform, well, I will have to confess that you wouldn't know very much for it is easy to get up here on a campaign train and say some nice sounding words, but out of our party you get a lot more than some high sounding words--you get first of all the record of twenty years of solid accomplishment, of accomplishment in the interests of all our people, and I hope you will compare this record with the Republican record before you vote--for, by the way, they have a record too during these past twenty years, and it is easy to sum up that record. Whenever there has been a forward looking, a constructive program to oppose, they have opposed it, and that is about all their record amounts to."

In fighting Communists at home, I shall rely on such experienced guardians of our security as J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and General Bedell Smith of the Central Intelligence Agency. These men fight Communism as it must be fought--with care, thoroughness, precision--and silence."

Each needs a special sort of ministry. Let us remember that, while Christ preached the doctrine of eternal salvation, he also did the work that needed to be done in the kingdom of man. He healed the sick, fed the poor, sustained the weak, and sheltered all those who were in want. So must we, I think, as Americans continue prudently to extend to the needy of this earth that material help which we almost alone can give. And we ought to do this not grudgingly, but with a clear recognition that it is far better to give than to receive. In a word, the first answer to Communism is not a lesser, but a fuller application of Judaic- Christian ethics to the neighborhood of nations around us."
9.24274316553487e-05,0.999907572568344,1045_13,0,"We can make our society ever more productive and more abundant and our people ever more free, but only if we have the purpose, the vision and the determination to do so. We can win peace in the world without a third world war, but only by dedicating our minds and our hearts, our sweat and our blood to that great task for as long as may be necessary. I tell you that the way to our goal is not easy, but the goal is worth the price, for the goal is nothing less than a nation fair and productive beyond our dreams and a world of law and order where men of good will can live together in equal dignity and under God. This is the future that we seek and this is the future for which I know we are willing to work and to sacrifice and to labor with all of our minds and with all of our hearts, and this is the cause to which we call you. We don't call it a crusade--we just call it, Forward with America."
9.85998368630957e-05,0.999901400163137,1054_5,0,"I think, regardless of political considerations, that it is essential that if we are going to win in the long term this conflict with Communists--this conflict with a society that seeks to spread itself over the entire globe--that we must recognize that until we find the means--and until we find cooperation in the means of restoring a sense of well-being to peoples who know little of freedom in the terms that we understand it, that we will have a very threatening and a hostile enemy. That is why one can believe that the importance of bolstering our defenses by the foreign aid programs--Point Four, and things of that kind--are essential if we are going to hope to frustrate the designs of this godless tyranny throughout the world. I thank you so much for affording me this opportunity of participating even briefly in the ceremonies. I count you very fortunate indeed to have this splendid housing development in your neighborhood; and I can add that I am very jealous of it. I should like to be participating in a similar project in Chicago where we too have desperate need of the advantages of public housing."

Who gave us the Marshall Plan which prevented the Kremlin's bloodless conquest of Western Europe? Who faced up to the Russians in Berlin when they tried to strangle and seize that city? Who insisted on the heroic airlift and who was it that hammered out the North Atlantic Alliance, which banded together the free people of Europe in a united defense against Communist aggression?"
9.60568804155261e-05,0.999903943119584,1074_2,0,"Then--then the people will vote on Tuesday. I understand that on Wednesday the newspapers plan to publish a Five-Star Final. Many thousands of our votes will come from rank-and-file Republicans who will vote with us. No doubt some Democrats will vote for the Republican candidates. We have already, for example, traded a couple of southern governors for the senator from Oregon and the vice chairman of the National Young Republicans. And I regard this as a profitable exchange for us. I would be happy to throw in a second baseman--but not Jackie Robinson."
0.000106245889169426,0.99989375411083,1083_5,0,"Democratic administrations have fought to bring these things to you, not because that would win votes, but because they were right and just and fair.  And we are going to continue to shout and do what we think is right to extend the gains that we have made here at home, and to fight for peace abroad. In the conduct of our foreign affairs we will suffer no tyranny over us, just as we will suffer no tyranny of one American over another.  We want to impose no tyranny on any other people.  We will remain free ourselves--more so.  We will find, as we have found before, the balance between the power we generate and the brakes that will check the power of those hostile to us.  In this way we can move in the wide open world as our fathers did when our nation was founded, and we can move unafraid.  I am reluctant to stop, although I have talked entirely too much, both here and all throughout this campaign.  All the same I have left much unsaid that is in my heart.  All I can do now is to thank all of you and, through you, thank all Americans for the privilege of your attention in these past months."
8.99601009844996e-05,0.999910039899015,1085_15,0,"No, I've seen and heard the deep-throated courage and confidence and faith of strong men and women and happy children--people who still believe in one another, in spite of all the timid, doubting men. And I thank them every one for the reception they have given me--for their infinite courtesy and their heartening friendliness.  I have asked you for your support for my candidacy. I ask you now for support of our common faith in this country. The confidence we've inherited is our greatest wealth, the source of our strength. "
9.55598308451916e-05,0.999904440169155,1101_15,0,"We are in that war because this administration allowed America, in a time when strength was needed, to become weak.  Consequently it felt compelled to take its forces out of that region. We are in that war because, having helped set up the Korean Republic, and knowing that strength was being massed against that republic north of its borders, there was a failure to build up adequate strength in Korea's own defense forces."
9.19824860663903e-05,0.999908017513933,1108_0,0,"Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen:  If I cannot be heard in the roar I have no objection to your crying louder, but I do not want to put any more strain on these poor old vocal chords, that are unaccustomed to the kind and amount of talking I have been doing lately, than I have to.  It is a very, very great pleasure to be here with you this morning. Once before I visited the Republican National Headquarters, but under different circumstances and certainly in accommodations far less commodious than these."
0.00303343662064843,0.996966563379352,1155_2,1,"Ladies and gentlemen, the campaign in which I am now engaged is in conformity with the promises I made to those people.  I think that the administration in Washington has gone too far in damaging, indeed leading toward destruction of the kind of America we have known, loved and believe in.  That administration has not led us intelligently toward peace.  It is spending more than it earns.  Indeed, it earns nothing.  It is spending more than it takes from us in the highest taxes we have ever had, and leaves a deficit in the budget that further cheapens our money."
0.000100228261110684,0.999899771738889,1155_3,0,"The policies they are now pursuing are destroying your insurance policies, your government bonds, your savings accounts and it is making it so that every day you must carry more money in your purse to the grocery store in order to get a decent basket of groceries.  If we do not stop that kind of thing, ladies and gentlemen, then America cannot be what it has been in the past.  We must have a solvent America, an America that lives within its means, yet so far have they gone with these spendthrift policies that the government itself says that last year every city family had to spend $400 more than that family could earn to pay for its shelter, its food, its clothing and other necessities in the family.  If that goes on, not only is this government going to be broke but all the families in it are going to be broke.  That is not America."
9.83844310454473e-05,0.999901615568955,1156_41,0,"It is true, of course, that the American taxpayer is burdened heavily by Soviet threat.  But what the Democratic nominee confessed was that under the present administration policy the American taxpayer is dancing to the Soviet tune and not getting for his tax dollar a clear, coherent plan to do away with the menace of war.  The telltale wording of that statement reflects the surrender of initiative to the Communists."
9.96377258781933e-05,0.999900362274122,1165_4,0,"Now, the government has stumbled and fumbled in failing to bring us closer to peace.  In the last seven years look what has happened to us.  We stopped the shooting war in 1945 the strongest military nation in the world, to say nothing of our academic strength and our spiritual, intellectual, scientific and moral strength.  We were the greatest military nation on the globe."

Of course, it's possible--though I doubt it--that the Savannah River, itself, has its source in a Washington Bureau. This, my friends, is a good year for some straight political thinking.  It is a bad year to be fooled.  It would be a particularly bad year to be fooled into thinking that the Washington mess is the fault of you, the people.  And we will not be fooled into the belief that this great land of ours and the progress we have achieved here are blessings handed down by government.  We are going to think straight--straight through to the conclusion that America is what free Americans--with courage and sweat and drive--have made it.  "
9.53237011779168e-05,0.999904676298822,1184_6,0,"Now if you will permit me one local word before I ask Mrs. Eisenhower to come out to wave to you, it is this:  Just as Michigan State is known for this great football team, and of which I now have a memento, it is also known for one thing that I have preached far and wide--proper agricultural research.  I am glad to have been here to pay tribute to its progress and its record in that field. Now friends, thank you again for turning out.  Let me bring out the better half of the Eisenhower tribe."

You know, folks, it strikes me that Senator Dirksen must indeed be a very powerful Senator when he can arrange by remote control such weather for this meeting.  I pay my compliments to him.  To each of you I extend my very warm thanks for coming here this afternoon, for giving me a chance to greet you, to say hello, and to express to you one or two thoughts that I have in mind as we progress in this political campaign."

All of us have gone up and down the country pledging not only the extension of those programs, but their correction, to make good the losses you have already suffered through inflation--in your bonds, in your savings accounts and in your pensions--and above all, to save whatever value still remains in the dollar.  At least, let's not let it go down from a present worth of 52 cents until it would be worth only twenty-five cents or less."
9.4354945787482e-05,0.999905645054212,1270_17,0,"We must call upon the best minds of our nations to sit down with political and economic leaders of other nations to find solutions to the crucial problems of international economic policy.  I believe that the wrecking of the London Economic Conference of 1933 was one of the great, though little understood, tragedies of our modern world.  We must make a fresh start."

So I am not certain what I shall say to you this morning.  I have just been traveling the roads of Nassau County, and never have I been greeted with more cordiality, with greater evidences of hospitality.  I am deeply grateful not only to everyone who was along the road this morning to wave a cheery hello, but to each of you here who has come out to allow me to bring a word of greeting and to express to you one or two of the thoughts on my mind as we go through his political campaign."

You have furnished a large share of the manpower and brain power which have made our farms and factories the most productive in the world.  Your people have been in the vanguard of the evolution in this country of an enlightened labor policy.  You have fought to defend America and the principles for which she stands."

0.595378457897815,0.404621542102185,1312_11,0,"What is extraordinary is that the present administration continues to pretend that none of these things have been so--that everything that has happened--every stolen secret, every disloyal official--is, they say, just an unfortunate, almost insignificant, accident. We could make some allowance for them if they had the honesty or the common sense, or both, to admit that they had been deceived and to show a stern purpose of preventing similar subversion in the future. There has been considerable concern--and rightfully so--about methods to be used in rooting Communism out of our government."

We are committed to the expansion and improvement of social security programs, particularly to saving what is left of our dollars so that your insurance policies, your old age insurance, your unemployment insurance and the rest of itdon't run out of your pocket through that big hole they call inflation.  Unless we stop that, there is no hope."

No one can know how you vote, and that is one of the priceless things for America--that you can do that.  No other person, no matter how close, can know what you do if you don't want him to."

But good intentions are not good enough and the country is stalled on dead center--stalled in the middle of the road--while the world goes whirling by. America, which has lifted man to his highest economic state, which has saved freedom in war and peace, which saved collective security, no longer sparks and flames and gives off new ideas and initiatives. Our lights are dimmed. We chat complacently of this and that while, in Carlyle's phrase, Death and eternity sit glaring. And I could add that opportunity, neglected opportunity, sits glaring too!"

Nor has any voice in Washington in these past two years spoken out more plainly and effectively for the rights of labor than that of Senator Pat McNamara. It is a special privilege for me to join you in saluting here today, on its twentieth anniversary, one of democracy's truly great organizations, the United Automobile Workers; and its president, my friend, one of freedom's truest and most effective servants, Walter Reuther."

Another Republican congressman suggested that classes were too small and that they should go into the evening and run twelve months of the year. And, though President Eisenhower was nominally in favor of aid to education, this particular congressman on April 12, 1956, read into the Record a letter from the President in which Mr. Eisenhower said, I would flatly oppose any grant by the federal government to all states in the Union for educational purposes. I am perplexed to say the least, but contradiction--unilateral as well as multilateral--seems to be about the only entertainment these Republicans have contrived."

The projects that have been built are monuments to the hard and persistent work of your representatives in Congress, of men like John McClellan and Bill Fulbright and the members of your House delegation. But they have succeeded only when the climate was right--that is, when your senators and congressmen had the sympathetic support of a Democratic administration instead of determined Republican opposition."

When he said that I blinked and thought again of Woodrow Wilson and the last-ditch Republican fight against the League of Nations. I thought of Franklin Roosevelt and the United Nations. I thought of the Truman Doctrine, and aid to Greece and Turkey. I thought of the Marshall Plan, Point 4, and NATO and the great Democratic struggle of a generation for peace, in which I am proud to have played a very small part myself."

First of all, we must rededicate ourselves to our faith in democracy and make that faith a living principle. In the Middle East, Israel is a beacon of democratic faith and of twentieth century progress. Our policy, therefore, should be founded on the firm cornerstone of the friendship of the American people for its democratic friend--Israel. For three years we have tried the ignoble, expedient policy of isolating Israel and trying to buy the friendship of dictators. Colonel Nasser has given us his answer. Appeasement has once again proved neither wise nor honorable nor expedient."

Just because this administration has not been able to make any progress toward safe disarmament or even toward controlling H-bomb development, does not mean that such agreements are forever impossible.

I suggest that, if I were anxious to win the confidence of the American people and remembering the Washington mess of only four years ago--there is one word that is the last that I would take from out the whole dictionary to use in a political argument--and that word is corruption. When this word is uttered in any political hall of the opposition, it echoes with a most curious ring. I know why, for I recall an old but grim proverb. It comes from the greatest Spanish novel ever written. And it warns: Never mention rope--in the house of one who has been hanged."

So I address myself to that problem and I feel very strongly about it.  I think I disagreed with Mr. Nixon on it.  He states that he is satisfied with what we are now doing.

Now, as the market price drops so drops the support price.  Where you had $1.50 for corn eight years ago, you may be getting 90 cents for corn today, or 93 cents.  That is the market price.

Mr. Nixon has chosen a different road.  He has gone to the American people in the 1960s, in the time of change and revolution, saying, We've never had it so good, saying our prestige in the world has never been higher.

In my judgment they are two: first, there is the point of view expressed by the Vice President that this country has never been stronger, that our security is assured, that we are experiencing and enjoying unprecedented prosperity from one end of the country to the other, and that the way to win the peace is by journeys through Eastern Europe in order to inform them of the value of freedom.

At the outset I would like this point clearly understood: the problems of farm people ought not be approached, as far too often has been the case in the past, as something to exploit for political advantage.

I think we must emphasize the things that unite America.  I pointed out in speaking to a great labor organization yesterday the fact that Mr. Kennedy had been in Detroit and made the statement that he was for everything union leaders were for, in effect, and that he opposed everything that they were against.  And I said to this group, Look, I'm for many of the things your leaders are for, but I'm not for all the things and I will not make a commitment that I'm for all the things that the leaders of unions or management or farm organizations or any other part or group of America are for, because a president must be president of all America and not just part of America."

That is why the next president of the United States must recognize that Mr. Khrushchev does not react like Mr. Nehru, he isn't like Mr. Adenauer, or Mr. Macmillan.  He is a man determined to conquer the world and so, first, we will keep America strong--the strongest in the world.  Second, we will see that the economy of this country moves forward so that Mr. Khrushchev never will be able to get through on his boast that he is going to catch us.

Add them all up and we ought to be able to renew our rivers, cleanse them, so that your children can swim in them and that the fish can come from them and that you can enjoy an afternoon alongside of them.

Now, in a way, I sympathize with his plight; for some time I have been wondering when he was going to find something to say that would not offend one of the Republican parties. Now, at last I think he has found it. In recent days, he has come forth with a fine free-swinging attack on that old punching-bag, corruption."

It is help of this kind that we can provide by sending agricultural experts, engineers and other trained people to these countries, and through programs of assistance for economic development. By working with each country to expand the production of goods which are needed by other countries in the region, a self-generating and self-financing cycle of trade and development can be initiated, which will reduce and can eventually eliminate the need for American aid. At the same time, we can enlarge or export markets and develop new sources of the products we need to import."

I had an uncle who lived here in Fresno years ago, and he owned a lot of property around here. I am told he sold it much too soon because what was his ranch is now a major portion of your city. And just think how, had he kept it, some of his descendants might have been able to find an easier way to earn a living than running for a political office."

Your extraordinary yields of long-staple cotton, melons, grapes, alfalfa, and all the other crops contribute to the well-being of all of us in the whole country.

Now, actually it doesn't make any difference whether it is Republican or Democratic rascality; a bad public servant is a bad apple and you throw out a bad apple whatever its variety. That is what I believe and I think that is what we are going to do at every level of our government, if the people are conscious enough of what their responsibility is. But rascals in government are only the uglier practices of wasters in government. Economy is just as important as honesty--for a taxpayer's dollar that is wasted is just as bad as a taxpayer's dollar that is stolen. And here again I lay what I hope is not an immodest claim to some hard and educational experience in making both ends of a government budget meet, in keeping a government lean and trimmed down to an efficient size. I have some idea about that; as the product of practical experience in Illinois, I have learned that economy in government isn't just something that you say you are going to have. You have to grind at it all of the time. You have to grind--everybody--up and down the ladder; the purchasing officers who spend millions of the taxpayers' money, the fellows who deal around in government orders, even the girls who want to use a fresh carbon every time they want to write a letter. It is the same old business day and night. You've got to live it yourself twenty-four hours a day."

This, perhaps above all others, has been the great contribution of the Democratic party in the last twenty years. In taking the nation out of the worst depression in its history, we reformed the economy so effectively that, under continuing wise leadership, there never need be another disastrous depression such as we have known in the past.

What the campaign has clearly brought out is that the Old Guard of the Republican party wants to scrap that bipartisan foreign policy--and that their candidate with the new look, the General of the Army, has either forsaken his own great past of becoming the policy partner of Senator Taft and some gentlemen of similarly eccentric views about our world."

It gives large scale application to the principle that flood control must begin at the top of the hill where the first trickle of water starts. It is the most important and hopeful attempt thus far made to reduce the crest of floods by holding back more water on the uplands where it falls and by retarding runoff of the remainder. From Virginia to California, from Iowa to Texas, I have seen evidence of America's need for flood control and soil conservation. This is one of the battles that must go forward if we are to build in the United States the fair and fruitful land of our dreams."

Above all, our Democratic platform calls for action on the overshadowing problems of war and peace--the most important unfinished business of our generation--and I mean steady resistance to Communism and patient and persistent efforts to build a peace which has been man's dearest goal from time immemorial. Now, in these few words--if these were all that you knew about me and about our Democratic platform, well, I will have to confess that you wouldn't know very much for it is easy to get up here on a campaign train and say some nice sounding words, but out of our party you get a lot more than some high sounding words--you get first of all the record of twenty years of solid accomplishment, of accomplishment in the interests of all our people, and I hope you will compare this record with the Republican record before you vote--for, by the way, they have a record too during these past twenty years, and it is easy to sum up that record. Whenever there has been a forward looking, a constructive program to oppose, they have opposed it, and that is about all their record amounts to."

And somewhere in this process America has fundamentally changed--a new view, a new compassion, a new faith has emerged. In a way it is a moral revival, and it has altered the tone and the meaning of our life. And how different a prospect faces a young man or a young woman of today from what faced the youth of my generation. The only or, most of all, the go-getter was the hero. Few cared about politics or public service -almost none who went through school or college with me took any positive interest in that, or have subsequently. Few had the sense of civil or social responsibility that we find today, when they were young."

I ask you: to whom should our people entrust the fight against Communism--to those Old Guard Republicans who, on one issue after another, vote the way our enemies like to see them vote? Or to those who have rallied the free world against Communist aggression?"

There is a provincial assumption--and fortunately not very widespread--that any man in public life in the South is bound to be a reactionary, or worse.

And we are going to continue to shout and do what we think is right to extend the gains that we have made here at home, and to fight for peace abroad. In the conduct of our foreign affairs we will suffer no tyranny over us, just as we will suffer no tyranny of one American over another.  We want to impose no tyranny on any other people.  We will remain free ourselves--more so.  We will find, as we have found before, the balance between the power we generate and the brakes that will check the power of those hostile to us.  In this way we can move in the wide open world as our fathers did when our nation was founded, and we can move unafraid.  I am reluctant to stop, although I have talked entirely too much, both here and all throughout this campaign.  All the same I have left much unsaid that is in my heart.  All I can do now is to thank all of you and, through you, thank all Americans for the privilege of your attention in these past months."

Consequently it felt compelled to take its forces out of that region. We are in that war because, having helped set up the Korean Republic, and knowing that strength was being massed against that republic north of its borders, there was a failure to build up adequate strength in Korea's own defense forces."

You people pitched in on your own.  You didn't even wait for a Washington bureaucrat to come down and do it.  You did it yourselves.  Moreover, I am told what you could expect in that little incident, that the elephant stayed on the job working until the last and the donkey played out--just too old, too tired."

But what the Democratic nominee confessed was that under the present administration policy the American taxpayer is dancing to the Soviet tune and not getting for his tax dollar a clear, coherent plan to do away with the menace of war.  The telltale wording of that statement reflects the surrender of initiative to the Communists."

They even call the great war in Korea a police action. Ladies and gentlemen, this all adds up to one simple thing--we have got to have a change and I am not expressing here just my individual opinion.  I am bringing to you what I believe I have seen in the faces and I know I have seen in the telegrams and the notes and the letters and the telephone calls of thousands of Americans.  We can no longer put up with that kind of leadership, a leadership that does not bring us closer to peace in the world and they well know that we can have no peace in the world as long as we have a government that cannot excite your pride.  Until it can excite your pride it is not going to earn the respect abroad that it must have if it is going to lead the world toward peace.  In my mind, that is the basic conclusion of American today.  Not only do we need a change, but we are going to have one."

You know, folks, it strikes me that Senator Dirksen must indeed be a very powerful Senator when he can arrange by remote control such weather for this meeting.  I pay my compliments to him.

Measures to deceive them worked so effectively that they estimated our original strength in Europe at seventy-five divisions instead of the actual thirty-six. In the entire American record in Europe there is no single instance where the enemy gained essential information of our plans through the medium of spies or subversive agents."

Those Americans, of course, are largely our new babies born.  When each baby is born today it gets a very extraordinary present as it arrives into this world:  it gets its share of the national debt; it owes $1,750 for the privilege of having been born."

I don't come before you, ladies and gentlemen, to make any long list of promises.  All the promises, the political promises, have been used up in the last 20 years anyway.  What I bring to you is a pledge, a pledge couched in the kind of thing that you people have a right to demand and expect of your government, that if you want to send the leaders of this crusade to Washington; they make this pledge now, they will above all things be honest; they will make it possible for all the agencies of the government that have the task of investigating--to make it possible for them to make their findings open to the public.

We will do them ladies and gentlemen only if we are a united people, united behind the great aspirations and purposes of our government.  And right there is the crux of the matter.  You must have a government that you trust, respect and believe in, if you are going to have a united United States.  A united United States would be a strong bulwark of peace.  A united strong United States can lead the free nations of the world into that kind of collective security program that will lift a great burden from our hearts:  the burden of fear abroad."

All of us have gone up and down the country pledging not only the extension of those programs, but their correction, to make good the losses you have already suffered through inflation--in your bonds, in your savings accounts and in your pensions--and above all, to save whatever value still remains in the dollar.  At least, let's not let it go down from a present worth of 52 cents until it would be worth only twenty-five cents or less."

Second, by skillful, aggressive, and ruthless prosecution of the Cold War, the Soviet Empire has added to its already great resources the important industrial complex of Central and Eastern Europe, and has added to its own large population six-hundred million human beings for use either as slave labor, or as expendable military masses."

I have just been traveling the roads of Nassau County, and never have I been greeted with more cordiality, with greater evidences of hospitality.

We want to see you develop yourselves with every single thing you have got in you and hold the government ready to help you whenever it is necessary, but to work with you and not just to work you. We believe that if we bring to Washington the outstanding men and women of this crusade--your representatives, people coming right out of this crowd, men who have been introduced to you from this platform--that all of those people will be your guarantee that there is no crookedness in government, that subversion and Communism isn't getting inside of government.

Here was a chance to place the United States in a position of active moral leadership, to mobilize the full force of world opinion against the Soviet institution of forced labor, and to establish our sympathy with the cause of these valiant workers behind the Iron Curtain who had risked their lives in the effort to throw off the yoke of servitude."

Another Republican congressman suggested that classes were too small and that they should go into the evening and run twelve months of the year. And, though President Eisenhower was nominally in favor of aid to education, this particular congressman on April 12, 1956, read into the Record a letter from the President in which Mr. Eisenhower said, I would flatly oppose any grant by the federal government to all states in the Union for educational purposes.

I think the people of this country do not view the vice presidency-- at least in these times-- as a casual incident. They know what the vice presidency is this nation's life insurance policy.

I suggest that, if I were anxious to win the confidence of the American people and remembering the Washington mess of only four years ago--there is one word that is the last that I would take from out the whole dictionary to use in a political argument--and that word is corruption. When this word is uttered in any political hall of the opposition, it echoes with a most curious ring. I know why, for I recall an old but grim proverb.

What is true of McDowell County and true of the coal industry will be true of other industries stretching across the United States.

The Senate is Democratic, and we could not mathematically lose control of the Senate. The House of Representatives is Democratic by a wide margin, and I doubt that the Democrats in the House of Representatives will lose control. Therefore, the prospect of four or eight years of a divided government, a government manned by a highly partisan figure, manned by a highly partisan party in the executive branch, and we have seen evidence of it in the last few days--how can we hope, at a time when we need action, how can we hope to possibly move ahead when on the one hand we say yes with the Democrats, and on the other hand we say no with the Republicans? The experience of the month of August in the Congress when both parties were vocally committed to great programs, housing, education, minimum wage, care for the aged--every program fell between the two opposing philosophies of the two parties."

If you are satisfied, if you feel happy about your life, if you feel our country is meeting its responsibilities, then you belong in Mr. Nixon's camp.  But if you share the view that I hold very vigorously that this country is going to have to do better in the future, that we have responsibilities to meet not only to ourselves but to the cause of freedom, that we are anxious to make sure that in the future people decide that these days were great days in the life of our country, that we must move forward, we must stimulate our growth, we must hold out an image to the world of a vigorous, dynamic society, if we are going to continue to lead the free world--I believe that is the choice.

Such efforts toward personal security, first, are right--not only from the humanitarian viewpoint, which all of us will understand--they are mandatory if our complex modern society is to work at its best, at its fullest.  They are essential to our purpose.  And what is that purpose?  I think, summed up in a sentence, it is this: we must lift the ceiling over personal opportunity.  We must strengthen the floor over the pit of personal disaster.  Public policy, therefore, should seek to put right what is wrong in our America, but it should also seek to strengthen what is right.  It should recognize the plain fact that Americans are proud and self-reliant individuals.

Not only are some cities, such as Washington, following San Francisco in the installation of fixed rail systems, but others are meeting their transportation needs through innovations such as exclusive-use rights-of-way for buses. I have sought to speed these developments by pushing for passage of the $10 billion Urban Mass Transportation Assistance Act of 1970 and by increasing the federal budget for mass transit from the previous high of $ 175 million in one year to St billion this year. The better transportation balance which we are striving for is indicated by the fact that in fiscal year 1973, for the first time, federal funds for urban mass transit will surpass spending on urban highways."

That was just two months before the start of the best recovery in postwar history. That's why, when I hear some of the projections they make for what it's going to be like in 1989--they're blowing smoke. They don't know what it's going to be like in 1989.

For it is a very solemn hour indeed, freighted with the hopes and fears of millions of mankind who see in us, the Democratic Party, sober understanding of the breadth and depth of the revolutionary currents in the world. Here and abroad they see in us awareness that there is no turning back, that, as Justice Holmes said, We must sail sometimes with the wind, sometimes against it; but we must sail and not drift or lie at anchor. They see in us, the Democratic Party that has steered this country through a storm of spears for twenty years, an understanding of a world in the torment of transition from an age that has died to an age struggling to be born. They see in us relentless determination to stand fast against the barbarian at the gate, to cultivate allies with a decent respect for the opinion of others, to patiently explore every misty path to peace and security, which is the only certainty of lower taxes and a better life."

Now, in a way, I sympathize with his plight; for some time I have been wondering when he was going to find something to say that would not offend one of the Republican parties.

It can be helped in a way that is natural to us and best for it; help in the ways of peace and of social progress. India has to grow more food. It has to restore its land.

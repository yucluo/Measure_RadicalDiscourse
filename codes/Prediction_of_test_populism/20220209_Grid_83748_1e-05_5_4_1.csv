Youngstown was not, in 1932, a pleasant place to work or to live--and Youngstown was typical of most of the cities of America. The steel mills here in the Mahoning Valley were working at 31 percent of capacity. One Youngstown working man out of every three was unemployed. There was no unemployment compensation. The other two men worked at poverty wages. There was no minimum wage law. Those men worked in silence beside the furnaces. There was no collective bargaining act. The foreman's word was law. The working man had no seniority rights in his job and there was almost no collective bargaining contracts; almost no unions. At the end of life's work when you could no longer work, there was nothing. There was no social security. You only knew that one day--and you never knew when--there would be a pink dismissal slip in your envelope, and that would be all. If it was bad at the mill, it was infinitely worse in the street and in the home. Youngstown was one of the first cities to start soup kitchens. So desperate indeed did the city of Youngstown become that the City Council..."

America is a great, a strong, a wise, and most of all a good country. And I believe with all my heart that by these qualities, we can and we will safely in God's good time win our way to a peaceful world."

And somewhere in this process America has fundamentally changed--a new view, a new compassion, a new faith has emerged. In a way it is a moral revival, and it has altered the tone and the meaning of our life. And how different a prospect faces a young man or a young woman of today from what faced the youth of my generation. The only or, most of all, the go-getter was the hero. Few cared about politics or public service -almost none who went through school or college with me took any positive interest in that, or have subsequently. Few had the sense of civil or social responsibility that we find today, when they were young."

Each needs a special sort of ministry. Let us remember that, while Christ preached the doctrine of eternal salvation, he also did the work that needed to be done in the kingdom of man. He healed the sick, fed the poor, sustained the weak, and sheltered all those who were in want. So must we, I think, as Americans continue prudently to extend to the needy of this earth that material help which we almost alone can give. And we ought to do this not grudgingly, but with a clear recognition that it is far better to give than to receive. In a word, the first answer to Communism is not a lesser, but a fuller application of Judaic- Christian ethics to the neighborhood of nations around us."

I think we must sweep out of the corridors of government, at all levels, national and state, those lingering suspicions which are a holdover from an earlier and very different time.  This is a problem which concerns me very deeply, for I am convinced that both government and business must learn to live together in harmony, before an era of bad temper turns into something infinitely worse. We must avoid at all costs the bitter struggle of class against class, which results inevitably in a drift either to the extreme left or to the extreme right. And you and I know that either kind of drift would end up at the same dreadful destination: a police state with all of the horrors that we have seen in Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia."

Many thousands of our votes will come from rank-and-file Republicans who will vote with us. No doubt some Democrats will vote for the Republican candidates. We have already, for example, traded a couple of southern governors for the senator from Oregon and the vice chairman of the National Young Republicans. And I regard this as a profitable exchange for us. I would be happy to throw in a second baseman--but not Jackie Robinson."

It is a record of opposition and harassment for 20 years, not only on price supports, but on all of the other Democratic programs on the storage program, rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, rural electric coops and so on.  The Republican Old Guard has never understood the philosophy behind these programs; it has never understood the programs themselves; it has never understood how they work.  The warning is plain; the Old Guard is hoping that the General can make his easy promises to farmers so convincing that they will forget about their own voting record."

You people pitched in on your own.  You didn't even wait for a Washington bureaucrat to come down and do it.  You did it yourselves.  Moreover, I am told what you could expect in that little incident, that the elephant stayed on the job working until the last and the donkey played out--just too old, too tired."

I think that the administration in Washington has gone too far in damaging, indeed leading toward destruction of the kind of America we have known, loved and believe in.  That administration has not led us intelligently toward peace.  It is spending more than it earns.  Indeed, it earns nothing.  It is spending more than it takes from us in the highest taxes we have ever had, and leaves a deficit in the budget that further cheapens our money."

It should be remembered that the negative votes on the North Atlantic Treaty, the Vandenberg Resolution and the Marshall Plan included negative votes of the party in power.  That is a tribute not just to a man but to a party.  Senator Vandenberg, if he were living, would be the first one to resent the suggestion that the votes to which I refer represented a personal triumph.  Rather, they represented to him the dedication of a party which, although it was an opposition party, subordinated partisan considerations to the national welfare."

Another of those blanks is that the Republican leaders would like to abolish all the gains that labor has made through these last years since the beginning of the century.  Ladies and gentlemen, sheer bunk!  I am not going to take time this morning to outline what the Republican Party is attempting to do in establishing the kind of climate in Washington where the labor-management problems can be settled without strikes, but I am going to repeat just briefly the promise I made to labor on Labor Day.  I said something to this effect: that four years from now, if you people had decided this fall to establish a Republican administration in Washington in the Executive Department, in the Senate of the United States, and in the Congress, that the leaders of that group would hope to stand before a crowd like this at the end of those four years, and each of you could look at the other and honestly say, Those people were fair; they were just; they settled everything on the basis of what is good for the United States of America, not just some particular section or group whose votes they were trying to buy--what was good for the United States of America.  Moreover, they would say and you would say to each other, They protected the rights of all--labor, management, professional men, farmers, everyone.  And finally, you would say, And besides being fair and just, they were friendly.  They were just people who belonged to us, one of us, not a bunch of long-haired bureaucrats in Washington who wanted to rule our lives from 3,000 miles away.  That was the pledge I made and I make it everywhere I go."

There can be no peace in this world until there is a strong America leading us toward peace--strong spiritually, economically, financially, and finally militarily. We are going to have that kind of strength only if we are united behind a government that excites our pride.  Such a government will have great prestige abroad; the free countries will want to join with us in establishing a collective security."

I don't come before you, ladies and gentlemen, to make any long list of promises.  All the promises, the political promises, have been used up in the last 20 years anyway.  What I bring to you is a pledge, a pledge couched in the kind of thing that you people have a right to demand and expect of your government, that if you want to send the leaders of this crusade to Washington; they make this pledge now, they will above all things be honest; they will make it possible for all the agencies of the government that have the task of investigating--to make it possible for them to make their findings open to the public.

Which makes it all the more necessary that we watch with a jaundiced eye anything that is unnecessary--all of the waste, the duplication, the inefficiency that we know about, and which you would not expect me here today at this time to enumerate.

The first thing I find is a wash-rag and it says, Clean up with Ike. I have got, of course, many, many reasons for being pleased when I get out into this country.  Ever since 1919, friends of mine have been asking me out to fish and hunt, and it has been a grand country, but of course, I don't much chance, so I spend a great deal of time reading western stories.

This party in power in the last seven years has used up every possible political promise there is, and some of them have gotten pretty shopworn.  For example, there is no easier way to duck an issue than to say this, I will promise you a law, well knowing they cannot deliver it.  There is no easier way to get out of a situation.  What I promise you is work, never ending work, to make certain that justice is done.  So I cannot come before you with the competition of promises, but I do come before you with a pledge, and this is the pledge.  If you want to put this crusade at the helm of your government; if you want to substitute for these 22 caliber men who are trying to hold 45 caliber jobs the finest men and women that we can draw from all sections of this country, from every walk of life--and let me say plainly, based upon merit and without respect to color or creed; if you want to have a government of that kind, then you belong in this crusade."

We want to see you develop yourselves with every single thing you have got in you and hold the government ready to help you whenever it is necessary, but to work with you and not just to work you. We believe that if we bring to Washington the outstanding men and women of this crusade--your representatives, people coming right out of this crowd, men who have been introduced to you from this platform--that all of those people will be your guarantee that there is no crookedness in government, that subversion and Communism isn't getting inside of government.

I hated everybody who hadn't been born ten generations back in the United States, and they thought I didn't know any American Indians, so this looked like a pretty good one.  They said I was anti-Catholic, anti-Negro, anti-Semitic, anti-everything.  Well, that one I didn't have to answer, my friends.

I remind him that his Secretary of Defense talked about workers out of jobs as kennel or hunting dogs, and that it was a White House assistant who said of unemployment this spring that the right to suffer is one of the joys of a free economy. And I want to say something, too, about another kind of indifference. I mean about the crisis in education in this country.

He secures the undeviating loyalty of the majority leader from Massachusetts, John McCormack, his strong right arm, because they know that he speaks not only for Bonham, Texas; he speaks for the United States.

For here and around the world, the fear of war hangs over us every morning and every night. It lies, expressed or silent, in the minds of every American. We cannot banish it by repeating that we are economically first or that we are militarily first, for saying so doesn't make it so.

The House of Representatives is Democratic by a wide margin, and I doubt that the Democrats in the House of Representatives will lose control.

I think we must emphasize the things that unite America.  I pointed out in speaking to a great labor organization yesterday the fact that Mr. Kennedy had been in Detroit and made the statement that he was for everything union leaders were for, in effect, and that he opposed everything that they were against.  And I said to this group, Look, I'm for many of the things your leaders are for, but I'm not for all the things and I will not make a commitment that I'm for all the things that the leaders of unions or management or farm organizations or any other part or group of America are for, because a president must be president of all America and not just part of America."

So, first, because he is a man who understands power and respects it, because he is a man who will use power if he can get away with it, to accomplish his ends, we must make sure that he never believes he is strong enough and that we are weak enough that he could start something without risking national suicide on his own part. And, so, the first necessity of leadership in these critical years ahead is that the United States must continue to be what she is today--the strongest nation in the world.  And, my friends, we must continue to maintain that advantage that we presently have, and the next president must be prepared to ask the American people for whatever was necessary to maintain it because through that strength in our hands, we serve the cause of peace.

The average teacher in America today starts at about $14,000 or $13,000 a year.  In some states it's far less.  I was in Florida a year ago, and I saw a teacher's schedule that showed a teacher who had twenty years of teaching with a doctorate degree made $17,000 a year.  I may be off a couple thousand, but I remember being shocked by the figure.  I have talked to any number of young people who went into teaching full of hope and found out they just couldn't stick with it, couldn't afford it.  I talked to a young man in New Hampshire.  I don't think he voted for me based on the returns, but we had a nice conversation.  He told me that, more than anything, he wanted to be a science teacher.  But he had a family of two kids, he was now thirty-six years of age.  He said, I couldn't do it.  I had to get out.  And I made double or triple whatever it was in the private sector.  What is happening today is that a lot of young, skilled people are not going into education.  The tests show that a disproportionate number are testing at the lowest levels of skills and aptitudes.  That doesn't mean a lot of them won't become good teachers.  We ought to have a society in which both in terms of the environment of teaching being honored as a profession and the pay, is such that the very best, the top of each class, goes into education.  I think last year--as I recall, in Los Angeles--I believe I was told that a beginning teacher there made $13,000 and a beginning policeman $28,000.  I don't begrudge the policeman's salary at all.  But we're saying something about teaching when we give it this low status, and, of course, our kids will pay and our nation will pay.  By now we should know that it is the product of the trained mind that is the greatest source of wealth in America.  It's more important than all of our national resources, everything.  That's from an economic standpoint.  But education, of course--that's why I use the word learning--goes to the basis of our democracy, to our personal enrichment and fulfillment, of our understanding of this ever more dangerous world in which we live.  Education does everything that we need.  And it all begins with what goes on in that classroom.  If it's not effective, if we don't have the best teaching, it's not going to work.  As president, I intend to put a tremendous amount of attention on this.  I've spent a lot of my life in it.  And I don't think there's any other way of getting it done except with presidential leadership."

Arkansas ranks near rock bottom for every important per capita crime dollar it spends: for prisons, forty-sixth; for judicial and legal systems, fiftieth; and when it comes to spending for police officers, Arkansas ranks forty-ninth."

Millions of American men and women waited in the breadlines. An army of ragged veterans actually marched on our national capital."

Here the rivers and roads and railroads from the east joined the great north-south highway, the Mississippi. Here, too, people came from all over the United States to begin the great adventures of going west. Beyond St. Louis was an empty land and a great future. "

We take our stand upon the fundamental principle that the role of government is, to sum up, just this: To remove the roadblocks put in the way of the people by nature and by greedy men; to release the energies of the people, so that free men may work the miracles of the future as they have worked the miracles of the past.  No man could travel across our country, as I have done, without being deeply stirred. No man then--his heart touched and his mind moved--could but reflect upon his country's destiny, his love for it the greater as perils encompass it. As we walk through a troubled time, let us remember that the United States was born to greatness. "

Today America is more prosperous than any other nation in history. Of course, the Old Guard orators are going around the country these days broadcasting gloomy warnings that our prosperity is a fake, that it is based on war, that a depression will come with peace. This is nonsense. The truth is that our tremendous defense effort is holding us back, gobbling up the goods our people need at home, and when we have at last won through to safer waters, we shall be able to work at a hundred and one tasks that need doing.

And I hope you will also think hard about what kind of foreign policy you want this country to follow in the years ahead. We face a long, tough, bitter struggle to preserve freedom in the world. We know in our hearts, all of us, that it is childish to suppose there is any simple solution, any easy answer. The lives of our sons are involved now, while we are fighting in Korea. The lives of everyone would be involved if that conflict were to grow into world war."

The issue then was whether the government would help make water available for small farmers who wanted to settle on new land. Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican president, put through that law, and we honor him for it. But as Theodore Roosevelt himself noted in his autobiography, he put the law through over the bitter opposition of the Old Guard Republicans in Congress. He observed that they consistently vote for local and private interests and against the interest of the people as a whole. And note, too that the original Reclamation Law was sponsored in the House of Representatives by Representative Newlands of Nevada, a Democrat. It passed by the votes of 77 Democrats and 69 Republicans."

It has been common knowledge, I thought, for a long time that the United States has been training and equipping Korean forces and that these forces are taking on more and more of the burden. I pointed this out some weeks ago and it has been frequently reported in the press over the past three years."

We must continue to meet the present urgent needs of the people. Too many Americans today dwell in misery in tenements in our huge congested cities--second-class citizens living in third class houses. Too many Americans still live in rags in sharecroppers' shacks. Too many Americans find that rising living costs are outrunning their pensions, social security benefits, life insurance proceeds and their salaries. The cost of living and wages have been chasing each other up and up in a dizzy, dangerous spiral of inflation that spells disaster for everyone. And we know what to do about that too, if the Republicans will just keep their hands off."

He wants you to believe the Republican party will make good on it. Well, the Republicans made the same pledge--the same promise--in their 1944 platform. But what happened? Two years later they gained control of the Eightieth Congress. They had a chance to make good on their promise. Did they make good? They not only did not fulfill that pledge--they actually took social security coverage away from more than a half million people."

Above all, our Democratic platform calls for action on the overshadowing problems of war and peace--the most important unfinished business of our generation--and I mean steady resistance to Communism and patient and persistent efforts to build a peace which has been man's dearest goal from time immemorial. Now, in these few words--if these were all that you knew about me and about our Democratic platform, well, I will have to confess that you wouldn't know very much for it is easy to get up here on a campaign train and say some nice sounding words, but out of our party you get a lot more than some high sounding words--you get first of all the record of twenty years of solid accomplishment, of accomplishment in the interests of all our people, and I hope you will compare this record with the Republican record before you vote--for, by the way, they have a record too during these past twenty years, and it is easy to sum up that record. Whenever there has been a forward looking, a constructive program to oppose, they have opposed it, and that is about all their record amounts to."

And somewhere in this process America has fundamentally changed--a new view, a new compassion, a new faith has emerged. In a way it is a moral revival, and it has altered the tone and the meaning of our life. And how different a prospect faces a young man or a young woman of today from what faced the youth of my generation. The only or, most of all, the go-getter was the hero. Few cared about politics or public service -almost none who went through school or college with me took any positive interest in that, or have subsequently. Few had the sense of civil or social responsibility that we find today, when they were young."

In fighting Communists at home, I shall rely on such experienced guardians of our security as J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and General Bedell Smith of the Central Intelligence Agency. These men fight Communism as it must be fought--with care, thoroughness, precision--and silence."

Each needs a special sort of ministry. Let us remember that, while Christ preached the doctrine of eternal salvation, he also did the work that needed to be done in the kingdom of man. He healed the sick, fed the poor, sustained the weak, and sheltered all those who were in want. So must we, I think, as Americans continue prudently to extend to the needy of this earth that material help which we almost alone can give. And we ought to do this not grudgingly, but with a clear recognition that it is far better to give than to receive. In a word, the first answer to Communism is not a lesser, but a fuller application of Judaic- Christian ethics to the neighborhood of nations around us."

We can win peace in the world without a third world war, but only by dedicating our minds and our hearts, our sweat and our blood to that great task for as long as may be necessary. I tell you that the way to our goal is not easy, but the goal is worth the price, for the goal is nothing less than a nation fair and productive beyond our dreams and a world of law and order where men of good will can live together in equal dignity and under God. This is the future that we seek and this is the future for which I know we are willing to work and to sacrifice and to labor with all of our minds and with all of our hearts, and this is the cause to which we call you.

That is why one can believe that the importance of bolstering our defenses by the foreign aid programs--Point Four, and things of that kind--are essential if we are going to hope to frustrate the designs of this godless tyranny throughout the world. I thank you so much for affording me this opportunity of participating even briefly in the ceremonies. I count you very fortunate indeed to have this splendid housing development in your neighborhood; and I can add that I am very jealous of it. I should like to be participating in a similar project in Chicago where we too have desperate need of the advantages of public housing."

We are doing the hard job that must be done if we are to have a secure place for ourselves and for those children.  We are following out the high ideals of Woodrow Wilson, who wanted to take us our full part--give us our full part--accept our full responsibility for securing the peace back in 1920 after the first World War.  The American people didn't listen to Wilson in those days.  We turned instead to people who led us away from the hard road of international cooperation to the easy  path of isolation.  If we had listened to him we might well have avoided the terrible trial of the second World War, in which 300,000 of our young men died."

I am down here for one purpose--to help get rid of the administration in Washington, an administration that has been living on emergencies and crises, emergencies that it manufactures. It likes the emergencies because out of them it makes the rugs, and a rug is a handy thing under which to sweep the evidence of your own errors and mistakes.

Here is something else we are going to cast out--governmental domination of the people it is supposed to serve.  When I talk about this you may get the idea that I am trying to be philosophical or highbrow, but believe me, this thing affects the lives of every one of us.  Like the rest of the things we will cast out, this too is a product of fear and lack of faith in the people.  This idea that government is the people's master is widespread in our world.  It is called by many names, but it always leads to the same destination.  It puts the gears of progress in reverse and carries society back to the days when the king was government and government was the final goal and the only power."

Young people with their idealism, their faith and their hopes must have a fair chance to shape the nation which will be theirs."

I think that the administration in Washington has gone too far in damaging, indeed leading toward destruction of the kind of America we have known, loved and believe in.  That administration has not led us intelligently toward peace.  It is spending more than it earns.  Indeed, it earns nothing.  It is spending more than it takes from us in the highest taxes we have ever had, and leaves a deficit in the budget that further cheapens our money."

At times the pitiless pressure of Communism has been checked by brave emergency attempts that rallied men of all parties to make up the deficiencies in our national leadership.  These attempts have produced the economic help of the Marshall Plan and the program of military aid to Greece and Turkey.  Both were enactments of the Republican 80th Congress, the Congress so long vilified by the administration.  These measures have helped to steady both the economic and the nervous systems of our allies.  They could hardly have been expected to do more in the making of our foreign policy.  Dollars and guns are no substitute for brains and willpower."

They even call the great war in Korea a police action. Ladies and gentlemen, this all adds up to one simple thing--we have got to have a change and I am not expressing here just my individual opinion.  I am bringing to you what I believe I have seen in the faces and I know I have seen in the telegrams and the notes and the letters and the telephone calls of thousands of Americans.  We can no longer put up with that kind of leadership, a leadership that does not bring us closer to peace in the world and they well know that we can have no peace in the world as long as we have a government that cannot excite your pride.  Until it can excite your pride it is not going to earn the respect abroad that it must have if it is going to lead the world toward peace.  In my mind, that is the basic conclusion of American today.  Not only do we need a change, but we are going to have one."

It is the day that marked the adoption of the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution.  In that Bill of Rights it specifies what are the rights of human beings as opposed to the power of government, the limits of what government can do to the individual today, and those ten amendments, possibly coupled with the organization our forefathers gave us, is the real genius of American government.  When those rights, any one of them, comes in peril from within or any threat from without, it is time for every loyal American, not just the rich, not just the farmers, not just the workmen, but everybody.  It is time for every loyal American to rise up, take a look, gird himself for battle, and fight off the encroachment."

Your governor, your new Senator, your Congressman--we must have them all--and with them and on behalf of all Republicans, I make these pledges to labor, to farmers, to businessmen, to every American:  first, if you want to change administrations this fall, if you want the group that the Republicans can put in the administration and in the Senate and in the House to take charge of this thing--clean it out and start us on a different road than we are now following--then they promise this:  There will be fairness, decency and justice prevailing in that administration, and they will serve you honestly as your servants and will not attempt to be your master.

Sheer bunk!  What the Republicans have said is this:  our purpose is to keep the dollar from going down further so that there will be no further erosion of your savings account, of your bank account, of your insurance policy and of your bonds.  But instead of seeing those things go down the drain of inflation you will keep them, and moreover they have said that where inflation has already overtaken some of these things, these amounts, and they have gone down below decency, that must be corrected, which means corrected upward.  They have also pledged in their platform to expand social security to go to classes not so far covered."

Another of those blanks is that the Republican leaders would like to abolish all the gains that labor has made through these last years since the beginning of the century.  Ladies and gentlemen, sheer bunk!  I am not going to take time this morning to outline what the Republican Party is attempting to do in establishing the kind of climate in Washington where the labor-management problems can be settled without strikes, but I am going to repeat just briefly the promise I made to labor on Labor Day.  I said something to this effect: that four years from now, if you people had decided this fall to establish a Republican administration in Washington in the Executive Department, in the Senate of the United States, and in the Congress, that the leaders of that group would hope to stand before a crowd like this at the end of those four years, and each of you could look at the other and honestly say, Those people were fair; they were just; they settled everything on the basis of what is good for the United States of America, not just some particular section or group whose votes they were trying to buy--what was good for the United States of America.  Moreover, they would say and you would say to each other, They protected the rights of all--labor, management, professional men, farmers, everyone.  And finally, you would say, And besides being fair and just, they were friendly.  They were just people who belonged to us, one of us, not a bunch of long-haired bureaucrats in Washington who wanted to rule our lives from 3,000 miles away.  That was the pledge I made and I make it everywhere I go."

I don't come before you, ladies and gentlemen, to make any long list of promises.  All the promises, the political promises, have been used up in the last 20 years anyway.  What I bring to you is a pledge, a pledge couched in the kind of thing that you people have a right to demand and expect of your government, that if you want to send the leaders of this crusade to Washington; they make this pledge now, they will above all things be honest; they will make it possible for all the agencies of the government that have the task of investigating--to make it possible for them to make their findings open to the public.

You give me a chance to look in your faces, to bring you a word of greeting, and to give you one or two of the thoughts that are on my mind as we go through this political campaign.  I have had a wonderful day and a half in your state, starting up at Sacramento.  It seems to me I have been covering ground very rapidly and every place there seems to be a new surprise.  Now, for example, here when the so-called professional politicians began to give me my lessons in this new art a few months back, they told me there was one thing you could not do-go to an airport and address a group of American citizens.  I was told they simply wouldn't come.  So I find out today that at least in Long Beach those political friends of mine were wrong, and I am delighted."

They will be consulted, and not the way they are consulted now:  You do this or you will get no more.  They will be consulted on what is the problem of their locality.

I think in many ways the election of 1960 comes at a time more dangerous for our country, more trying for all of us, a period of greater responsibility for every citizen than any election since the election of 1860.  In that time, as you recall, the great issue was whether this country could stay united, whether it would, in the words of Lincoln, exist half slave and half free.  The issue in the election of 1960 involves not only the well-being of the people of this valley, involves not only the development of your natural resources, but as citizens of the United States and leaders of the free world, we must be concerned about such far-off places as the Congo, India, and Indonesia, the security of those countries, as well as the well-being of their people.

The House of Representatives is Democratic by a wide margin, and I doubt that the Democrats in the House of Representatives will lose control.

Now, as the market price drops so drops the support price.  Where you had $1.50 for corn eight years ago, you may be getting 90 cents for corn today, or 93 cents.  That is the market price.

With regard to our steel industry, this bill gives the president new authority to enforce agreements we may enter into with our trading partners as part of the steel policy that I announced on September 18th, 1984. This legislation will enable us to enforce steel export restraints, guard against unfair import surges into the American market, and help keep the United States from becoming the world's steel dump.

It would be a sad thing, indeed, it seems to me, if a great soldier to whom we owe undying affection and gratitude ended up politically between the two Republican parties like that mule I heard about one time that starved to death standing between two stacks of hay, trying to make up his mind which to eat. Now, in a way, I sympathize with his plight; for some time I have been wondering when he was going to find something to say that would not offend one of the Republican parties. Now, at last I think he has found it. In recent days, he has come forth with a fine free-swinging attack on that old punching-bag, corruption."

The Hoover Commission has made suggestions for increasing the effectiveness of executive review; it may be that even better means can be devised, and I propose to find out. "

It is help of this kind that we can provide by sending agricultural experts, engineers and other trained people to these countries, and through programs of assistance for economic development. By working with each country to expand the production of goods which are needed by other countries in the region, a self-generating and self-financing cycle of trade and development can be initiated, which will reduce and can eventually eliminate the need for American aid. At the same time, we can enlarge or export markets and develop new sources of the products we need to import."

Too many Americans find that rising living costs are outrunning their pensions, social security benefits, life insurance proceeds and their salaries. The cost of living and wages have been chasing each other up and up in a dizzy, dangerous spiral of inflation that spells disaster for everyone.

Two years later they gained control of the Eightieth Congress. They had a chance to make good on their promise. Did they make good? They not only did not fulfill that pledge--they actually took social security coverage away from more than a half million people."

In fighting Communists at home, I shall rely on such experienced guardians of our security as J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and General Bedell Smith of the Central Intelligence Agency. These men fight Communism as it must be fought--with care, thoroughness, precision--and silence."

In all events, I am very grateful to all of you for being here this afternoon. I have just had a most interesting experience. I was presented on the rear platform of the train with an enormous placard--here it is--they are all of the Ike buttons, gathered by the Volunteers for Stevenson from people who have switched."

They were merely beautifying the state highway at the access point of the city, where it began to come into the city. And where it had been shabby and ugly and messy they were cleaning it up around there and developing a picnic area--that sort of thing--and an infinite variety of things. Also, of course, from the point of view of the public official, it is a wonderful access point to communities."

I have never felt better; I feel frustrated only by the difficulty I have had in engaging in any genuine debate with the Republicans; and, as far as my sense of humor is concerned, I hope it is intact. And I hope the time will never come when the Republican party gets into office and forbids any humor in political campaigns."

We are for the dynamic system of enterprise which has grown out of the great partnership of public and private initiative in this country.  We are against socialism--creeping, crawling, loping, galloping, or even the make-believe kind that takes up so much space in the Republican oratory these days."

It is a record of opposition and harassment for 20 years, not only on price supports, but on all of the other Democratic programs on the storage program, rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, rural electric coops and so on.  The Republican Old Guard has never understood the philosophy behind these programs; it has never understood the programs themselves; it has never understood how they work.  The warning is plain; the Old Guard is hoping that the General can make his easy promises to farmers so convincing that they will forget about their own voting record."

We can make sure that the whole atmosphere of our government is one of common honesty. With honesty, we will have competence. We will set an example of industry and integrity which will again make free government the shining object of admiration and respect throughout the world."

Lately it seems to be too much in the nation.  We do these things together because no one can do them for himself alone.  We must approach those group problems with a spirit of cooperation, a readiness to accept the responsibilities of each of us which are group in character.  If we do not do that then there comes that creeping tide of central law that finally results in the all-powerful state, and we do it because we are regimented.  Let us do our jobs at home, first in the family, then in the village, then in the state.  Let's not let the central government get any more of them than we have to."

My first two days were spent in six southern cities. I was interested to see what were the subjects that seemed to interest them most, subjects involving national problems and the national scene, and then to compare those with similar reactions in the north. In my opinion they are identical."

First, we shall cast away the incompetent, the unfit, the cronies, and the chiselers.  And it won't take years of Congressional investigation and a lot of tax money to clean out the mess."

It is a very, very great pleasure to be here with you this morning. Once before I visited the Republican National Headquarters, but under different circumstances and certainly in accommodations far less commodious than these."

My convictions would require it.   The federal government did not create the states in this republic.  The states created the federal government.  The creation should not supersede the creator."

They are serious for every American.  That is the way I shall continue to treat them.  Especially are these problems serious for what we oldsters call the younger generation.  Young people with their idealism, their faith and their hopes must have a fair chance to shape the nation which will be theirs."

What I am discussing as I go around is the incompetent leadership you have gotten over the past seven years from your administration in Washington.  And I go into the various subjects of our lack of progress toward peace, our excessive expenditures on the federal level, the deficits that are cheapening our money, the crises that are going up, the taxes that grow more and more burdensome; and, with all of the necessary expenditures for defense organisms that we must have, still a kind of incompetence in government that gets two airfields in North Africa for the price of five and the kind of thing going on in the Justice Department that led an ex-under secretary, a high official in the Justice Department, to say only yesterday, Why, if my ex-chief should tell all he knew, they would blow the White House so high that the power of gravity could not bring it back."

It demands harmony and understanding between the executive and legislative branches of our government. It will demand an end to what the Senate Preparedness Subcommittee has called abuse, misuse and disuse of power."

Your governor, your new Senator, your Congressman--we must have them all--and with them and on behalf of all Republicans, I make these pledges to labor, to farmers, to businessmen, to every American:  first, if you want to change administrations this fall, if you want the group that the Republicans can put in the administration and in the Senate and in the House to take charge of this thing--clean it out and start us on a different road than we are now following--then they promise this:  There will be fairness, decency and justice prevailing in that administration, and they will serve you honestly as your servants and will not attempt to be your master.  That is the first pledge they make."
8.46842029479156e-05,0.999915315797052,1184_6,0,"Now if you will permit me one local word before I ask Mrs. Eisenhower to come out to wave to you, it is this:  Just as Michigan State is known for this great football team, and of which I now have a memento, it is also known for one thing that I have preached far and wide--proper agricultural research.  I am glad to have been here to pay tribute to its progress and its record in that field. Now friends, thank you again for turning out.  Let me bring out the better half of the Eisenhower tribe."
8.51359316976217e-05,0.999914864068302,1188_9,0,"I do not propose to talk tonight as if the American people had not lived through a great depression.  Its causes were many, and its costs in human distress were terrible. It is our pledge that the full power of government and every national resource will be devoted to seeing that it shall never again happen in America."
8.61486010536723e-05,0.999913851398946,1197_11,0,"There are a lot of other parts to this verbal barrage.  For example, the Republicans are accused of attempting to abolish social security.  Sheer bunk!  What the Republicans have said is this:  our purpose is to keep the dollar from going down further so that there will be no further erosion of your savings account, of your bank account, of your insurance policy and of your bonds.  But instead of seeing those things go down the drain of inflation you will keep them, and moreover they have said that where inflation has already overtaken some of these things, these amounts, and they have gone down below decency, that must be corrected, which means corrected upward.  They have also pledged in their platform to expand social security to go to classes not so far covered."
8.62080164372502e-05,0.999913791983563,1241_7,0,"They fear, they say, that a new administration, not of the Fair Deal type, would take away all our social security programs.  Again, what rot!  All of us have gone up and down the country pledging not only the extension of those programs, but their correction, to make good the losses you have already suffered through inflation--in your bonds, in your savings accounts and in your pensions--and above all, to save whatever value still remains in the dollar.  At least, let's not let it go down from a present worth of 52 cents until it would be worth only twenty-five cents or less."
8.84926253774736e-05,0.999911507374622,1247_45,0,"This, then, is the faith that can heal those sick with doubt, comfort those afflicted with tyranny, refresh those wearied by freedom's exhausting battle. This is the faith--not in the fiction of the abstract common man, but in the wondrous fact that every man is an uncommon man.  He is the infinitely precious, utterly unique individual of living flesh, whose spirit has such strength that he can endure and survive oppression and poverty, disease and imprisonment, to keep alive his soul's love of freedom."
9.08496847877479e-05,0.999909150315212,1269_21,0,"A strong America, a well-governed America, an America that is morally and spiritually sound, is the best answer to the evil threat of cynicism and lack of self-respect within, and to the evil threat of Communism without.  If you believe that as I do, will you join our crusade? This crusade which I have taken to the American people represents what I, myself, believe.  I have acted and I have spoken from my own deep inner convictions of what is best and right for America.  I have been steadfast to my convictions.  I have made no deals.  I am still a no deal man.  And let me tell you just this:  I have lived sixty-two years and one week and I have never been anyone's captive yet.  And never will be!"
8.88657192068028e-05,0.999911134280793,1300_38,0,"A: You know, fortunately, Mr. Nagel, this morning there was a very significant item in the paper. It was this: There was quoted a top-secret document of the American Defense Department. How it got there, we will never know probably. But that top-secret document brought out one fact that really answers your question. It was this. There was a military estimate made in September 1947 by military men, and it had this conclusion: The military occupation of South Korea is not essential to the military security of the United States of America."
0.999650399718356,0.00034960028164417,1303_4,1,"The essential difference between this worn-out bureaucracy in Washington and the crusade is this:  They want to sit in Washington and direct your lives and your businesses and check up on you from thousands or hundreds of miles away.  We want to see you develop yourselves with every single thing you have got in you and hold the government ready to help you whenever it is necessary, but to work with you and not just to work you. We believe that if we bring to Washington the outstanding men and women of this crusade--your representatives, people coming right out of this crowd, men who have been introduced to you from this platform--that all of those people will be your guarantee that there is no crookedness in government, that subversion and Communism isn't getting inside of government.  They will be your guarantee that if a stray individual does go bad and betrays his trust, that kind of thing will be ripped out of government without delay."
8.93216495508089e-05,0.999910678350449,1322_8,0,"Yet the administration had opportunities to do something about this pledge. The AFL and CIO presented them with a golden chance to do just this when it called for an international convention against the use of slave labor. Here was a chance to place the United States in a position of active moral leadership, to mobilize the full force of world opinion against the Soviet institution of forced labor, and to establish our sympathy with the cause of these valiant workers behind the Iron Curtain who had risked their lives in the effort to throw off the yoke of servitude."
8.54923065068248e-05,0.999914507693493,1326_13,0,"Even more is it true that our hopes for peace in the world are still far from realization, the ultimate peace far from being won. I said earlier this week at the American Legion Convention in Los Angeles that: There is not peace--the peace we seek--while our sons and brothers are still being drafted for two years of military service, their schooling interrupted, their normal lives postponed."

9.13268961097308e-05,0.999908673103891,1374_20,1,"The fact is that the Republicans, taking over the country at a high point of economic activity, have done nothing for such vital groups in the population as small businessmen and farmers--and have done less than nothing to prepare for the difficult problems of the future. The Eisenhower administration seems to have confused genuine friendship for business with snuggling intimacy toward a few of its giants. And meanwhile the big have gotten bigger and the small are disappearing."
8.68372554068253e-05,0.999913162744594,1374_9,0,"I believe that the need for this interaction--for this balanced and reciprocal cooperation--has never been greater than it is today. For our society is in a state of transition. We have moved out of the bleak past, when our problem was scarcity and our task the hard one of distributing too few goods among too many people. We are finally entering that age of abundance, of which we have dreamed so long."
8.58728937972824e-05,0.999914127106203,1377_5,0,"At Peoria, four years later, the President told his Republican audience that what he meant at Kasson, was that farmers should get their parity in the marketplace. If that means anything, it means they should get parity without price supports. And if that is what Mr. Eisenhower meant, why didn't he say so four years ago? He didn't say so because he knew that any such statement would have cost him."
0.000105567542878312,0.999894432457122,1384_8,0,It's a wonderful technique these Republicans have. A measure passes in spite of this opposition. And then President Eisenhower claims it as a Republican accomplishment. You might call this the politics of adoption. Or you might call it just plain deceit.
8.59765442878936e-05,0.999914023455712,1389_25,0,"Our strength is the strength of the democratic tradition and the democratic faith in our national life--a tradition and faith that stretches back to Thomas Jefferson; a tradition and faith which have been responsible for nearly every step ahead in freedom and welfare in modern history of our nation. We live in a time of revolutionary change. Before our eyes, in the very headlines of our daily papers, a new world is being born."
8.83243517482383e-05,0.999911675648252,1391_15,0,"And distasteful as this matter is, I must say bluntly that every piece of scientific evidence we have, every lesson of history and experience, indicates that a Republican victory tomorrow would mean that Richard M. Nixon would probably be president of this country within the next four years. I say frankly, as a citizen more than a candidate, that I recoil at the prospect of Mr. Nixon as custodian of this nation's future, as guardian of the hydrogen bomb, as representative of America in the world, as Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces. Distasteful as it is, this is the truth, the central truth, about the most fateful decision the American people have to make tomorrow. I have full confidence in that decision."

Our atomic knowledge and power have forged the saving shield of freedom. And the future use and control of atomic power can be assured, not by any theatrical national gesture, but only by explicit and supervised international agreements."

Now first of all, I feel great, largely because of the way you have greeted me. But tonight I am reminded, my friends, of the time when last we met here in the Garden four years ago."

This train is headed not only south, but it is headed toward Washington.  I think in many ways the election of 1960 comes at a time more dangerous for our country, more trying for all of us, a period of greater responsibility for every citizen than any election since the election of 1860.  In that time, as you recall, the great issue was whether this country could stay united, whether it would, in the words of Lincoln, exist half slave and half free.  The issue in the election of 1960 involves not only the well-being of the people of this valley, involves not only the development of your natural resources, but as citizens of the United States and leaders of the free world, we must be concerned about such far-off places as the Congo, India, and Indonesia, the security of those countries, as well as the well-being of their people.

I don't think there is any man in this century who has written more significant legislation of benefit to the people than Speaker Rayburn. He does it. He secures the support of the members of the House of Representatives from all states of the Union. He secures the undeviating loyalty of the majority leader from Massachusetts, John McCormack, his strong right arm, because they know that he speaks not only for Bonham, Texas; he speaks for the United States. And Lyndon Johnson, unanimously chosen on three different occasions by every senator of the United States in the Democratic Party to be the majority leader, was chosen because he was not only a senator from Texas, but a senator of the United States."
8.584730769046e-05,0.99991415269231,1482_2,0,"We want a country moving ahead here at home.  Last year the Soviet Union exceeded the economical growth of this country by three times.  Last year we had the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.  We've got a million and a half people coming into the market every year seeking jobs.  Unless this country moves ahead, unless we continue to grow, unless our defenses are strong, unless we're educating our children, unless we are showing in every way, in science, in space, and here in Texas, that this country is first, not to follow when or where, but first--and that's what the Democratic party wants to do in the 1960s."

But in 1960, the cause of liberalism cannot content itself with carrying on the fight for human justice and economic liberalism here at home. For here and around the world, the fear of war hangs over us every morning and every night. It lies, expressed or silent, in the minds of every American. We cannot banish it by repeating that we are economically first or that we are militarily first, for saying so doesn't make it so. More will be needed than goodwill missions or talking back to Soviet politicians or increasing the tempo of the arms race. More will be needed than good intentions, for we know where that paving leads."

We cannot be bound by the last eight years. We cannot be committed by a party of the past. We cannot wait for Mr. Khrushchev's words, for the Communists are not satisfied with their gains of the last months, with their lead in missiles and space, and their foothold in Cuba, and half of Indochina, and their new influence in Laos and Africa and Asia. They will keep on driving and expanding and gaining without regard to all the kitchen debates and without regard to what goes on in the United Nations unless we have a president and a country in the 1960s that acts first and acts fast.

The Senate is Democratic, and we could not mathematically lose control of the Senate. The House of Representatives is Democratic by a wide margin, and I doubt that the Democrats in the House of Representatives will lose control. Therefore, the prospect of four or eight years of a divided government, a government manned by a highly partisan figure, manned by a highly partisan party in the executive branch, and we have seen evidence of it in the last few days--how can we hope, at a time when we need action, how can we hope to possibly move ahead when on the one hand we say yes with the Democrats, and on the other hand we say no with the Republicans? The experience of the month of August in the Congress when both parties were vocally committed to great programs, housing, education, minimum wage, care for the aged--every program fell between the two opposing philosophies of the two parties."

I am not at all. I could not possibly feel stronger about this country and about what it can do. But I think the Republicans have put limitations on what we can do. We want to upgrade the leadership. We want to make this country in a position of unmatched security, both at home and abroad."

Every time that we fail to meet our problems, every time that we fail to move our economy forward, we fail not only our own people, but we fail all those who look to us for leadership.  My judgment is that there is a very clear choice between the Republican and the Democratic parties.  They stand for different things, and they have stood for different things all through this century.  Woodrow Wilson, running in 1912, said that the Republican party idea of policy is to sit on the lid.  Franklin Roosevelt carried the fight in 1932 and 1936 and Harry Truman carried the fight in 1948, and on the issues which matter, housing, social security, medical care for the aged, minimum wage, development of the resources of this country, I believe the Democratic party looks forward.

There are 15 million American homes, according to the last Bureau of the Census, which are substandard.  Mr. Nixon has issued a paper on housing, and this, I think, is most revealing of all and one of the most endearing qualities of the Vice President.  In his position paper issued in New York within the last three weeks, he says that the Housing Act of 1949 has worked very well, and do you know as a congressman he voted against it?  In that position paper he called for greater emphasis on middle-income housing and he voted against that in 1950.  He calls for a greater flow of housing credit so that the American people can buy houses at low rates of interest.  But he neglects to mention his vote as vice president to increase the interest rates on the GI housing bans.  High interest rates never built a single home and one of the reasons why we are building 200,000 less homes each year than we should to keep up with our population increase is because of the high interest rate policy of this administration."

But we can't get this done unless we also look at the other side of the ledger. We don't cut our way to prosperity. We've got to ask the wealthiest among us to pay higher taxes on incomes over $250,000, which is the same rate we had when Bill Clinton was President, our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs, the biggest surplus in history, and a lot of millionaires did well too.

Because Americans had the courage to stand for freedom, our children today do not have the fear of nuclear weapons. And I am proud to have been a part of that. Governor Clinton says that the United States is somewhere below Germany and just above Sri Lanka. And I say to him he ought to open his eyes. Because of what you did--and many of you today--in Desert Storm, we are the most respected nation on the face of the Earth. And don't let him tear down America. Don't let him tear it down. Because we had the courage to stand for freedom, the world today now holds unprecedented opportunity. We've got to be ready for it. And in this election, I am proud of my record as commander in chief of the Armed Forces. I'm going to take the case to the American people that you can't be on both sides of every issue when you make a tough decision. You've got to do what is right for the United States."

They're doing this not out of personal spite, but they're doing this because of the record.

And no one would benefit more from keeping violent criminals behind bars which we will do in our administration. Keep them locked up. They're not going to commit any crimes. If they commit a violent crime, they go to jail. And they stay in jail and they serve their time."

Quotas are designed to divide the economic--existing economic pie into smaller and smaller and smaller pieces. But, if we create growth and opportunity where everyone can succeed without taking from someone else--and I read a piece in this mornings news--why are you having trouble with your economic package, your tax cut? This independent survey, they said, 81.5 percent of the media coverage has been negative. So, when they're out there every day saying how bad it is. How do you expect anybody to believe in it?"

He stood for the things I think are right. He stood for them in the way that was right. I think of him particularly today because he retained--as mayor, governor, attorney general and supreme court justice--the humility which is all too rare a quality among democracy's leaders. He never, even from the heights of public service he reached, looked down on people. He always looked up to them. Recalling what Frank Murphy stood for is about the best advice a candidate for the presidency could give himself on Labor Day of this election year."

And that need for hospital and clinical facilities is by no means satisfied, as every doctor will agree. I am talking, too, about a sound program which I hope we can develop to reduce the financial hazards of serious illness and remove the fear of husbands and fathers that a sudden accident or sickness will force his family on to public charity. And I don't mean what has been called socialized medicine either."

I don't think the tearful and interminable post-mortems about China will save any souls for democracy in the rest of Asia, the Near East, and in Africa. India is not caught up in civil strife. It can be helped in a way that is natural to us and best for it; help in the ways of peace and of social progress. India has to grow more food. It has to restore its land. It needs new resources of power. In short, it needs a democratic helping hand in the development programs it has already charted for itself."

Its effect is to make the free world itself--both because of its freedom and because of its strength--a potent counter-attraction to Soviet power. And the emergence of this world, united, powerful, friendly and free, will exert an ever-increasing influence on the captive states within the Soviet Empire."

It is good of you to have come here today. I am happy to have this opportunity to come here myself. Much of our history has been written here in Connecticut, history of which we are all inordinately proud; history which reveals to us many risks."

He has picked up these strange ideas from the men around him--bitter obstructionists who oppose these programs in Congress and who seek now to divert attention from the record with baseless, hollow warnings about iron-fisted regimentation, and a sinister government. In short, the General has fallen victim to the same old Republican oratory we've been hearing for the past twenty years."

We take our stand upon the fundamental principle that the role of government is, to sum up, just this: To remove the roadblocks put in the way of the people by nature and by greedy men; to release the energies of the people, so that free men may work the miracles of the future as they have worked the miracles of the past.  No man could travel across our country, as I have done, without being deeply stirred. No man then--his heart touched and his mind moved--could but reflect upon his country's destiny, his love for it the greater as perils encompass it. As we walk through a troubled time, let us remember that the United States was born to greatness. "

This time he says that it is real, all right, but that it is based on war--that, without rearmament, our good times would disappear. That is a familiar argument these days. And do you know where you will hear it most often?--outside the Republican National Committee, of course, The answer to that is on the Communist radio in Moscow."

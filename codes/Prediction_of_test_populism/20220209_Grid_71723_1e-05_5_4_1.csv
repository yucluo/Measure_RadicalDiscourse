We are opposing it at home where its agents and converts seek to undermine our society and corrupt our government. As I have repeatedly said, the federal government must use all its resources to expose and identify Communistic activity, to keep Communists out of places of responsibility in our society, and to protect our institutions from Communist espionage, sabotage and subversion."

In all events, I am very grateful to all of you for being here this afternoon. I have just had a most interesting experience.

They are awful keen about this law enforcement, but they continue to use all these devices in their own posts. So it is a little incongruous. They say, By gosh, we are going to clean up crime in this community and get those slot machines out of that corner saloon. But of course, as far as our Legion Post, or VFW, or whatever it is, that belongs to us and it is certainly a different situation. And after all, the device is set to give the fellow at least a sixty to a hundred chance of winning as against one chance in a hundred in the commercial device; and, after all, we own the machine, and it is not owned by a syndicate of operators and placed on a rental basis.

I think we must sweep out of the corridors of government, at all levels, national and state, those lingering suspicions which are a holdover from an earlier and very different time.  This is a problem which concerns me very deeply, for I am convinced that both government and business must learn to live together in harmony, before an era of bad temper turns into something infinitely worse. We must avoid at all costs the bitter struggle of class against class, which results inevitably in a drift either to the extreme left or to the extreme right. And you and I know that either kind of drift would end up at the same dreadful destination: a police state with all of the horrors that we have seen in Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia."

Once we have gotten that thought in our minds so that we never forget it, ladies and gentlemen, we can clean out corruption.  Why, think of it, think of the votes we can roll up on November 4th.  We can bring down taxes; we can stop the terrific taxes that are piling up your prices.  An economist came into me the other day, one of these fellows, you know, that dig out the facts.  Every time you eat a boiled egg, unless you raise it yourself, you pay 100 taxes on that egg, one hundred taxes and then we wonder where the prices come from."

Now, in this crowd, ladies and gentlemen, there are numbers of men who are my old comrades in arms.  Some of them may have fought in the Far Pacific; some may have had duties that kept them in the U.S.; many of them went abroad with me.  And I used to see those fellows along the roads, in the camps, sometimes at reviews, in their barracks, in their kitchen, wherever; and we used to talk about why we were fighting.  And we came to the agreement in simple terms that we were fighting to keep America the kind of land that we believe it to be--a land of freedom and opportunity, not a land dominated by a Hitler or by any group of bureaucrats.  The reason I am in this political campaign, my friends, is in a continuation of that promise.  I am trying to do my part to keep America the kind of country we have always known, which means first of all that you must have a government you can respect and other nations will likewise respect it because you do."

Your governor, your new Senator, your Congressman--we must have them all--and with them and on behalf of all Republicans, I make these pledges to labor, to farmers, to businessmen, to every American:  first, if you want to change administrations this fall, if you want the group that the Republicans can put in the administration and in the Senate and in the House to take charge of this thing--clean it out and start us on a different road than we are now following--then they promise this:  There will be fairness, decency and justice prevailing in that administration, and they will serve you honestly as your servants and will not attempt to be your master.

This is the faith--not in the fiction of the abstract common man, but in the wondrous fact that every man is an uncommon man.  He is the infinitely precious, utterly unique individual of living flesh, whose spirit has such strength that he can endure and survive oppression and poverty, disease and imprisonment, to keep alive his soul's love of freedom."

And now we come to another glaring example of our national leadership's failure to live up to high ideals.  I refer to the McCarran Immigration Law, which was passed over the president's veto at the last session of Congress.  A new immigration law was certainly needed.  But with leadership, rather than vetoes, we should have had, and we must get, a better law than this McCarran Act."

Now, if we are going to have a fresh start on this thing, we have got to have a complete change in the political complexion in Washington.  I picked up this morning a little clipping.  I am going to read to you just two sentences:  In South Bend, Indiana, yesterday, someone from the crowd addressed by the Democratic candidate, the administration's hand-picked candidate, shouted this question, Would you fire Acheson?   And it says here, Dean Acheson, the Secretary of State, and the answer was this, I will answer questions like that after the election, the Governor replied.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is the only answer the poor man could make.  He has the record, this sorry record of the last seven years to defend, and here is one he can't defend; but he can't on the other hand, say in advance, I repudiate that record and the people who have made it.  But I say, this crusade in which I am engaged does repudiate that record of error, and we are ready to replace from top to bottom.  No one has anything but admiration for the great body of public servants of America who are contained in the civil service and in the uniformed services.  We are talking, in this top to bottom clean-out, about these political appointees, the policy-makers, if you please, of our country--and not only in domestic policy but in this foreign field."

But it happens that we have been the ones who are preaching that the greater fear and the threat of our time is Communism, and the only way to fight Communism is with a prosperous America--an America that is fully employed, with working men and women at good jobs with good pay, with farmers prosperous.

We could make some allowance for them if they had the honesty or the common sense, or both, to admit that they had been deceived and to show a stern purpose of preventing similar subversion in the future.

The Republican leadership cannot hope to meet the challenge of the future--because it can hardly bear to live in the present. The pace of change is quickening every moment, with every new discovery in our laboratories, every new invention in our workshops, every new upsurge of human ambition and hope in the revolutionary turbulence of the world.

I think in many ways the election of 1960 comes at a time more dangerous for our country, more trying for all of us, a period of greater responsibility for every citizen than any election since the election of 1860.  In that time, as you recall, the great issue was whether this country could stay united, whether it would, in the words of Lincoln, exist half slave and half free.  The issue in the election of 1960 involves not only the well-being of the people of this valley, involves not only the development of your natural resources, but as citizens of the United States and leaders of the free world, we must be concerned about such far-off places as the Congo, India, and Indonesia, the security of those countries, as well as the well-being of their people.

He secures the undeviating loyalty of the majority leader from Massachusetts, John McCormack, his strong right arm, because they know that he speaks not only for Bonham, Texas; he speaks for the United States.

Other Democratic presidents in this country--Woodrow Wilson, who served in this city, in this state, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman--all faced difficult and dangerous times.

Mr. Nixon could not run on the program that he runs on if he recognized our times.  He could not run on the program that our power and prestige is at its height, that of the communists at the lowest it has been, that everything is all right and being done in its proper measure.  The very fact that he chooses that as his campaign indicates that he could not suddenly reverse in 1961 and determine on action.  If he really believes these things he says, in my opinion he disqualifies himself.  If he does not believe them, and runs on that program, he makes the same mistake that Stanley Baldwin made in England in 1935 which almost destroyed Great Britain, by misleading the people of England in 1935.  He prevented them, by not telling them the truth, he prevented them from arming at a time when it might have been possible to prevent the disaster of Munich."

Mr. Nixon has run on a slogan that we have never had it so good.  It indicates his belief that we are moving in a period now, to quote him, of unparalleled prosperity, that the United States is moving in a position of strength and vitality, and that everything that must be done is being done in good measure.  He looks around the world and he sees the United States with our prestige at an all-time high, and that of the Communists at an all-time low.  I look at the world and I look at the United States, and I don't see his picture at all, and I am not, as the Democratic candidate for office, going to run for the presidency in 1960 with any belief or any view that it is worthwhile getting elected president if we have to run on a platform which is totally unrealistic.  This country is not moving ahead like it is going to have to move ahead if we are going to meet our responsibilities to ourselves, to those who come after us, to those who look to us around the world for leadership.  And our position in the world is not unparalleled; our prestige has been higher.  Our strength relative to that of the Communists has been greater.  If Mr. Nixon hopes to be president of the United States and present the United States to the world in the same image that he now presents it in this campaign, I could not disagree with him more.  I hope you share the view with me that we want the truth with the bark off.  The people of the United States want to face the facts.

I made my judgment long ago that the basic issue of this campaign was the question of whether the people of the United States believed it was time they started moving again, that they started going forward again, and that the greatest contribution that they could make to the cause of freedom was to build a strong and vital society here in the United States.  Mr. Nixon has chosen a different road.  He has gone to the American people in the 1960s, in the time of change and revolution, saying, We've never had it so good, saying our prestige in the world has never been higher.

What I want to do today is to talk over with you some of my views based on this serious study. At the outset I would like this point clearly understood: the problems of farm people ought not be approached, as far too often has been the case in the past, as something to exploit for political advantage.  Rather, the approach has got to be objective, and has got to be constructive.  In a determined effort to find a solution, the good of the farmer, not the good of politicians, has to be our steady purpose if we are ever to get anywhere."

The thing that ran through my mind I'm sure was what would run through your mind--that the most important question and the most important responsibility for the next president of the United States is to see that those boys and thousands like them are always in uniforms of peace and never have to be in uniforms of war. And so I say to you today that the most important responsibility of the next president is to keep the peace without surrender and that is the question you should ask--which of the candidates--which of the two for president and vice president will best provide that leadership.

Such efforts toward personal security, first, are right--not only from the humanitarian viewpoint, which all of us will understand--they are mandatory if our complex modern society is to work at its best, at its fullest.  They are essential to our purpose.  And what is that purpose?  I think, summed up in a sentence, it is this: we must lift the ceiling over personal opportunity.  We must strengthen the floor over the pit of personal disaster.  Public policy, therefore, should seek to put right what is wrong in our America, but it should also seek to strengthen what is right.  It should recognize the plain fact that Americans are proud and self-reliant individuals.  Programs that encourage individuals to depend on government are wrong, for increasing dependence by a people upon government is not a sign of strength; it is a sign of weakness, and in this day of competition with the Communists, Americans must be sturdy and strong."

The federal government, with its ability to raise funds on a national basis, should aim at reducing the discrepancies among the various states in their resources for the support of education. State government must bear the legal responsibility of setting standards for attendance, teacher certification, per-pupil expenditure and the development of long range plans.

None ever asked me for help, and none could have been improperly influenced by these gifts, because I gave them and I appointed them to their jobs and I could have discharged them at any time. Two of them have left the state service long since--one to become vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and the other is now a justice of the Illinois State Supreme Court."

He has picked up these strange ideas from the men around him--bitter obstructionists who oppose these programs in Congress and who seek now to divert attention from the record with baseless, hollow warnings about iron-fisted regimentation, and a sinister government. In short, the General has fallen victim to the same old Republican oratory we've been hearing for the past twenty years."

I say let us glory in the service of our sons--and let us honor them by facing squarely and soberly the truth about the world today. This is not just an election to be won by one man or another. Four years of America's future hang in the balance, four historic years of decision, hard decisions."

Here the rivers and roads and railroads from the east joined the great north-south highway, the Mississippi. Here, too, people came from all over the United States to begin the great adventures of going west. Beyond St. Louis was an empty land and a great future. "

We take our stand upon the fundamental principle that the role of government is, to sum up, just this: To remove the roadblocks put in the way of the people by nature and by greedy men; to release the energies of the people, so that free men may work the miracles of the future as they have worked the miracles of the past.  No man could travel across our country, as I have done, without being deeply stirred. No man then--his heart touched and his mind moved--could but reflect upon his country's destiny, his love for it the greater as perils encompass it. As we walk through a troubled time, let us remember that the United States was born to greatness. "

And I hope you will also think hard about what kind of foreign policy you want this country to follow in the years ahead. We face a long, tough, bitter struggle to preserve freedom in the world. We know in our hearts, all of us, that it is childish to suppose there is any simple solution, any easy answer. The lives of our sons are involved now, while we are fighting in Korea. The lives of everyone would be involved if that conflict were to grow into world war."

He cannot be appeased; he can never be bought off by the surrender of territory or by the betrayal of some trusting ally, even if we were capable of such treachery.  For his aim is total conquest--not merely of the earth, but of the human mind.  He seeks to destroy the very idea of freedom, the concept of God Himself."

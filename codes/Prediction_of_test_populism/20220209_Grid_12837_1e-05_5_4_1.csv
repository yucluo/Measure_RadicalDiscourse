And one reason for this is that it has become harder and harder instead of easier and easier to tell precisely what the Republican party stands for in this campaign. I confess it is early in the morning to be harsh about anybody and to be very critical of anybody. I don't want to be critical or harsh. I have in mind that we are now only a week from our election and we still don't know precisely what the Republicans propose to do about much of anything. We know where they stand on the matter of a new labor relations law, for example. That is precisely where they stood for the past five years. That is an old Republican position."

I think we must sweep out of the corridors of government, at all levels, national and state, those lingering suspicions which are a holdover from an earlier and very different time.  This is a problem which concerns me very deeply, for I am convinced that both government and business must learn to live together in harmony, before an era of bad temper turns into something infinitely worse. We must avoid at all costs the bitter struggle of class against class, which results inevitably in a drift either to the extreme left or to the extreme right. And you and I know that either kind of drift would end up at the same dreadful destination: a police state with all of the horrors that we have seen in Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia."

Many thousands of our votes will come from rank-and-file Republicans who will vote with us. No doubt some Democrats will vote for the Republican candidates.

Lately it seems to be too much in the nation.  We do these things together because no one can do them for himself alone.  We must approach those group problems with a spirit of cooperation, a readiness to accept the responsibilities of each of us which are group in character.  If we do not do that then there comes that creeping tide of central law that finally results in the all-powerful state, and we do it because we are regimented.  Let us do our jobs at home, first in the family, then in the village, then in the state.  Let's not let the central government get any more of them than we have to."

Now, in this crowd, ladies and gentlemen, there are numbers of men who are my old comrades in arms.  Some of them may have fought in the Far Pacific; some may have had duties that kept them in the U.S.; many of them went abroad with me.  And I used to see those fellows along the roads, in the camps, sometimes at reviews, in their barracks, in their kitchen, wherever; and we used to talk about why we were fighting.  And we came to the agreement in simple terms that we were fighting to keep America the kind of land that we believe it to be--a land of freedom and opportunity, not a land dominated by a Hitler or by any group of bureaucrats.  The reason I am in this political campaign, my friends, is in a continuation of that promise.  I am trying to do my part to keep America the kind of country we have always known, which means first of all that you must have a government you can respect and other nations will likewise respect it because you do."

Of course, it's possible--though I doubt it--that the Savannah River, itself, has its source in a Washington Bureau. This, my friends, is a good year for some straight political thinking.  It is a bad year to be fooled.  It would be a particularly bad year to be fooled into thinking that the Washington mess is the fault of you, the people.

Sheer bunk!  What the Republicans have said is this:  our purpose is to keep the dollar from going down further so that there will be no further erosion of your savings account, of your bank account, of your insurance policy and of your bonds.  But instead of seeing those things go down the drain of inflation you will keep them, and moreover they have said that where inflation has already overtaken some of these things, these amounts, and they have gone down below decency, that must be corrected, which means corrected upward.

Never do I get tired of reminiscing about the heroism, the sacrifices, the devotion to our country of the millions of men and women who made up our fighting forces in World War II.

I think the people of this country do not view the vice presidency-- at least in these times-- as a casual incident. They know what the vice presidency is this nation's life insurance policy.

After Woodrow Wilson talked for a few minutes however, with great feeling and great fire of his desire for a unified world and a world of peace, Governor Cox broke in and said, We are behind you 100 percent, and they fought that campaign in part to implement the ideal of Woodrow Wilson for the establishment of the League of Nations, and lost.  But Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt, in losing that election in 1920, held before themselves and the people their concept of the service that they can render in an election, of attempting to turn the attention of the people to the great issues that face us, and the great possibilities that lie in action in the future.  And I believe in this election 40 years later, we merely do not run for office, but we also seek to establish a basic point, that what this country is now doing is not good enough, that in the 1960s, if we are going to maintain our freedom, if we are going to meet our commitments at home and abroad, we have to do better, and that is the basic issue which has separated Mr. Nixon and myself."

Now, this morning the papers reveal, and I have the New York Times in my hand, that the Information Service of our state department has been conducting polls throughout ten countries of the world to try to find out their view of the United States.  These polls have been confidential, but the papers evidently got hold of them.  Here is what the headline says, and it really goes to the whole issue of this campaign: The U.S. Survey Finds That Others Consider the Soviet the Mightiest.

I made my judgment long ago that the basic issue of this campaign was the question of whether the people of the United States believed it was time they started moving again, that they started going forward again, and that the greatest contribution that they could make to the cause of freedom was to build a strong and vital society here in the United States.  Mr. Nixon has chosen a different road.  He has gone to the American people in the 1960s, in the time of change and revolution, saying, We've never had it so good, saying our prestige in the world has never been higher.  I recall in 1935, when Winston Churchill was warning of the dangers of the Nazi rise, Stanley Baldwin, the leader of the Conservative party, told the people of England that everything was being done in its own good time.

At the outset I would like this point clearly understood: the problems of farm people ought not be approached, as far too often has been the case in the past, as something to exploit for political advantage.  Rather, the approach has got to be objective, and has got to be constructive.

They are not like the people you and I know in this country.  They have an entirely different set of values.  They are people who are determined to conquer the world and they will follow no rules of the game whatever, and this means, in other words, that we need, in order to deal with them, to develop the strength, we need to have the realism, which will effectively stop their plans and stop them without war."

But again, we don't stand on it.  How do I say that we can do this job?  Well, first, when you look at my colleague and I, we know Mr. Khrushchev.  We have sat down across the conference table with him.  We know that he is a man who is ruthless and tough.  We know that you must never make him a concession unless you get a concession in return.  That's why President Eisenhower was right in not doing what Mr. Khrushchev asked him to do again in the paper this morning, in not apologizing and not expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev as Senator Kennedy suggested he might.  That is why the next president of the United States must recognize that Mr. Khrushchev does not react like Mr. Nehru, he isn't like Mr. Adenauer, or Mr. Macmillan.  He is a man determined to conquer the world and so, first, we will keep America strong--the strongest in the world.  Second, we will see that the economy of this country moves forward so that Mr. Khrushchev never will be able to get through on his boast that he is going to catch us.  Third, we will see that we are firm, but we will never be belligerent, because we realize that while we hold the line for principle, we must always negotiate for peace, but never, again, making concessions, as I say, which don't get concessions in return."

The Senator who voted against the $87 billion for our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq is the same Senator who has voted against vital weapons systems during his entire career. He tried to cancel the Patriot missile, which shot down Scud missiles in Operation Desert Storm. He opposed the B-1 bomber, which was critical to victory in the Afghan campaign. He opposed the B-2 stealth bomber, which delivered devastating air strikes on Taliban positions. He opposed the modernized F-14D, which we used against terrorists in Tora Bora.

And, my friends, we have been marching to that  music, to Democratic administrations, and we passed Medicare and more aid to education to help our children than any other administration in the history of this country and we passed more civil rights legislation and we have done more for our job training and more opportunity than any political party or any administration.  That's why we are proud to be Democrats.  And you can tell your grandchildren that you were there when America awoke from eight years of fitful sleep, the great GOP slumber, and moved forward once again under Kennedy, under Johnson, and now under Humphrey and Muskie.  Yes, Mr. Nixon says, and now listen to what he says, because really it's hard to understand what he says.  It's a little confusing.  Listen to what he says.  He says, If you elect Hubert Humphrey, it will be more of the same.  And you know, that fellow is beginning to tell the truth.  It's new Nixon when it comes to that.  And, by the way, friends, don't worry about the new one, don't even worry about the old one; what you've got to worry about is the real Nixon.  That's the one you got to worry about "

Secondly, the taxpayers financed it--not by subsidies to the grain farmers, but to the export subsidies that went to the tune of more than $100 million beyond what could be justified to the great grain exporting companies. And now we read on yesterday that these grain speculators want to crawl through an unjustified loophole in the tax law known as the Disc System that would exempt 50% of these windfall profits from any tax at all.

Not only are some cities, such as Washington, following San Francisco in the installation of fixed rail systems, but others are meeting their transportation needs through innovations such as exclusive-use rights-of-way for buses. I have sought to speed these developments by pushing for passage of the $10 billion Urban Mass Transportation Assistance Act of 1970 and by increasing the federal budget for mass transit from the previous high of $ 175 million in one year to St billion this year. The better transportation balance which we are striving for is indicated by the fact that in fiscal year 1973, for the first time, federal funds for urban mass transit will surpass spending on urban highways."

The average teacher in America today starts at about $14,000 or $13,000 a year.  In some states it's far less.  I was in Florida a year ago, and I saw a teacher's schedule that showed a teacher who had twenty years of teaching with a doctorate degree made $17,000 a year.  I may be off a couple thousand, but I remember being shocked by the figure.  I have talked to any number of young people who went into teaching full of hope and found out they just couldn't stick with it, couldn't afford it.  I talked to a young man in New Hampshire.  I don't think he voted for me based on the returns, but we had a nice conversation.  He told me that, more than anything, he wanted to be a science teacher.  But he had a family of two kids, he was now thirty-six years of age.  He said, I couldn't do it.  I had to get out.  And I made double or triple whatever it was in the private sector.  What is happening today is that a lot of young, skilled people are not going into education.  The tests show that a disproportionate number are testing at the lowest levels of skills and aptitudes.  That doesn't mean a lot of them won't become good teachers.  We ought to have a society in which both in terms of the environment of teaching being honored as a profession and the pay, is such that the very best, the top of each class, goes into education.  I think last year--as I recall, in Los Angeles--I believe I was told that a beginning teacher there made $13,000 and a beginning policeman $28,000.  I don't begrudge the policeman's salary at all.  But we're saying something about teaching when we give it this low status, and, of course, our kids will pay and our nation will pay.  By now we should know that it is the product of the trained mind that is the greatest source of wealth in America.  It's more important than all of our national resources, everything.  That's from an economic standpoint.  But education, of course--that's why I use the word learning--goes to the basis of our democracy, to our personal enrichment and fulfillment, of our understanding of this ever more dangerous world in which we live.  Education does everything that we need.  And it all begins with what goes on in that classroom.  If it's not effective, if we don't have the best teaching, it's not going to work.  As president, I intend to put a tremendous amount of attention on this.  I've spent a lot of my life in it.

Now, actually it doesn't make any difference whether it is Republican or Democratic rascality; a bad public servant is a bad apple and you throw out a bad apple whatever its variety. That is what I believe and I think that is what we are going to do at every level of our government, if the people are conscious enough of what their responsibility is. But rascals in government are only the uglier practices of wasters in government. Economy is just as important as honesty--for a taxpayer's dollar that is wasted is just as bad as a taxpayer's dollar that is stolen. And here again I lay what I hope is not an immodest claim to some hard and educational experience in making both ends of a government budget meet, in keeping a government lean and trimmed down to an efficient size. I have some idea about that; as the product of practical experience in Illinois, I have learned that economy in government isn't just something that you say you are going to have. You have to grind at it all of the time. You have to grind--everybody--up and down the ladder; the purchasing officers who spend millions of the taxpayers' money, the fellows who deal around in government orders, even the girls who want to use a fresh carbon every time they want to write a letter. It is the same old business day and night. You've got to live it yourself twenty-four hours a day."

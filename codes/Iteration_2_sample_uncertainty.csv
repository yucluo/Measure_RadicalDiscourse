The label has changed, but not the stuff in the package. Much as many Americans hope otherwise, official Republicanism remains a policy of indifference to much except the aspirations of property. It remains the spokesman of big business and wealth. Nor should we complain. That is a wholly legitimate function. But it is not the proper function of government, of the executive branch, in this beloved country of ours.America needs today, and needs badly, the restoration of government, which recognizes the existence of people--which will seek to meet their needs, to guarantee their rights, and to enlarge their opportunities. It is the nature and tradition of the Democratic party and of the Liberal tradition to care about people--and care about them, not as statistics in a market survey, but as individual men and women and children.

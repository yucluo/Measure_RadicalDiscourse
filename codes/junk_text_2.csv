But the one area where I've asked for substantial increase and support is for education and learning and science and training, because if we don't do that we'll be slipping backwards.  I think it's the best investment we make.  So, there's a $4.5 billion program over four years that goes to local school districts that is patterned on the Ford Foundation experience of trying to bring the community together to look at their schools with the advice of teachers, administrators, students, business community, legislators, to see what can be done to make those schools as effective as possible and to provide the resources that are needed:  teacher pay, school days, school years, curriculum, whatever the local community decides it needs.",dem,1984,TRUE,FALSE,0,2710_0,169

We haven't seen nothing.  That's not very good grammar, but it's the point.  Let me say three or four facts I think are astonishing.  Mr. Reagan is the first president since Hoover not to meet with his Soviet counterpart.  Mr. Reagan has opposed every effort of every president since Kennedy, of both political parties, to control armaments--every one of the efforts.  Opposed every one of them.  He is the first president since the bomb went off not to make any programs on arms control.  We now not only have a dangerous arms race.  He is proposing to extend that arms race into the heavens.  He has a thing about arms control.  He says the supporters of the freeze are dupes of Moscow when, in fact, those of us who want to control armaments, who want a freeze, I believe are speaking not only for a vast majority of the American people, but we are saying what needs to be done to control this madness before it destroys us all.  Finally, he cracks jokes about this problem that aren't very funny.  We need a president who is committed and who understands that gaining control of those god-awful weapons is the issue of our lifetime, because if we don't control them it can destroy the human species.

But as most corporate leaders will tell you, they are profit-making organizations and that their duty under the law is to their stockholders.  And if you expect them to be the major source now for support for education, I don't think it's very likely.  Secondly, you get into some severe problems--and I've talked to many graduate schools where some corporations want to help provided the university does what it is told.  That destroys the function of a university.  Any help they give, I think it's important.

I may be off a couple thousand, but I remember being shocked by the figure.

I don't think he voted for me based on the returns, but we had a nice conversation.  He told me that, more than anything, he wanted to be a science teacher.

The American people, particularly young people, cannot be expected to take pride or even participate in a system of government that is defiled and dishonored, whether in the White House or in the halls of Congress.

A lot of people differed on the Vietnam War, but you can't have it both ways, protect your viability and then fail to level. On April 17th, Governor Clinton said, """"I'm going to make all my records available on the draft."""" Fine. We haven't heard it yet. You cannot waffle.

They have said that it costs too much, forgetting that, however expensive peace may be, it will cost as nothing compared to a new world war. I think that on balance our policies have been mightily successful. They have rallied and united the free world and have checked the spread of Communism. If the democracies had pursued policies of a comparable boldness in the thirties, we might have averted the Second World War. If we stick with these policies, I deeply believe, we shall avert a Third World War.",dem,1952,True,True,17

Well, it's true that the American people depleted their savings by 20 percent to buy clothes for their kids to go back to school and furniture. And it's true that he went on a flurry of arms sales to affect critical states as we get toward the election, and that boosted the economy. But if you look at the long-term impacts, we are eighteen months after the bottom of this recession, and we're still doing worse than at any comparable period since before World War II. In this administration, for the first time since before World War II, we've had a decline in jobs in the private sector and a decline in personal income. So, when Mr. Bush tells us we should rejoice at our economic plight, I think we have to tell him it's time to move beyond the passivity and complacency of his presidency and of this campaign.",dem,1992,False,True,2

He looked in the camera the other night with a straight face and said he's not going to raise taxes on anyone who earns less than $200,000. The problem with that is to keep that promise, he would have to break almost all of his other ones. He has proposed more than $2.2 trillion in new Federal spending. That's trillion with a """"T.""""

	Thank you. Well, it's a great honor to be among the Lakeland Community College Campus, who are part of the Community College in Ohio.

	We're...[missing text]...to thank you...[missing text]...for the great job you're doing here. As you probably know, or maybe you don't know, I have roots in Williams County, Ohio. In fact, I visited there about three weeks ago, visited the grave of my great-great-grandfather. My grandfather moved from Ohio to Kansas. So I consider Ohio one of my home states, and I expect to carry every home state--in the election.

	And I know you're all pretty happy about the fact that I had...[missing text]. And I'm happy I won't be here this afternoon because nobody will be here. They're all going to be watching the Indians beat Buffalo. The Governor has invited me back for the World Series some time in late October, and I'll be here.

	Steve...[missing text], I want to thank you for warming the crowd up, and thank you for being here. Silver--see that silver medal--he loaned it to me a couple times. Yeah, right there. There it is. And if anybody gives you any trouble here, he's going to take care of them.

	I believe the American people are just beginning to sort of sit up and take notice of this very important campaign of 1996. They are only now focusing on a real choice in this election, a choice between...[missing text]...and old-style, liberal, big government and a new kind of leadership dedicated to cutting taxes, balancing the budget and trusting the American people.  And that's the kind of leadership Jack Kemp and I stand for, and that's why we're going to win on November 5. Make no mistake about it.

	And did I make a good choice in picking Jack Kemp? He's done a great job in this campaign. He's been to Ohio and he's back here again...[missing text]. Right now he's out in California working. I didn't see my wife--I understand she was riding a motorbike last night...[missing text]...bikers...[missing text]...show? [Missing text]...so I appreciate that, too.

	There are just five weeks left before the election, then I'll be the president-elect of the United States of America. And we're going to use every day, and every opportunity to repeat our message of less government and more growth and leadership worthy of your trust. And I'll be saying that America's families know how to spend their money better than any government bureaucracy. And I'll be saying the American people haven't had a tax cut for ten years and it's overdue. And I'll be saying that taxes are too high so long as an American family spends more on their taxes, which they do, than on food, clothing, and shelter combined. It's time for a change. It's time for a tax cut.

	And I'll be saying that the...[missing text]...is not good enough. They're not on the right track so long as too many two-earner families, where one spouse works full time for the family and the other spouse has to work full time to pay the taxes. That should not happen in America. If they both want to work, that's fine. It's tough to bring home the bacon when the government lives so high on the hog. You manage...[missing text]...to pay the rent...[missing text].

	So for Jack Kemp and myself, our tax cut is just the beginning of a move to a flatter, fairer, simpler tax that will end the IRS as we know it, end the IRS as we know it.

	Now we won't be satisfied until once again, in families across America, both spouses work because they want to work, not because they're forced to work to pay higher taxes. And that's why this election goes...[missing text]...down to two distinct visions of government in America's future. One vision, President Clinton's liberal vision, is that of a government by and for the bureaucrats and special interests. The other vision--I believe...[missing text]...is a government of, by, and for the American people. That's the key difference. That's the key difference. Clinton trusts the government and we trust the people. That's a big, big difference.

	And we're going to have a little debate coming up on Sunday night. I want to show up and meet this--he is so good, if I show up, I think I win--you know. Because he doesn't care what he says. He'll say anything...[missing text]...believe it...[missing text]...so I want to give you today a little consumer guide to the debates, a guide that a promise was made and a promise was broken. So you can have this little score sheet if you're not selecting...[missing text]...something else more exciting.

	Now one, Clinton is going to tell...[missing text]...Sunday night, is he, he will cut your taxes...[missing text]...he called them, if he's reelected. Now, when he was running for president last time, he came to Ohio, he made the exact same promise--he called it his middle-class tax cut--in one of his earlier debates in New Hampshire, he called a middle-class tax cut central to his plan. And months later during the presidential debate, he dangled the same middle-class tax cut he promised before the audience.

	And that wasn't the only promise he made. Some of you may remember the 1992 presidential debates...[missing text]...that's where Bill Clinton stood before the pulpit, and declared, and I quote, "I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for my programs." He said that not just once but four times during that debate. It was one of the promises he made the last time he debated before a national audience. And you know the story from there. When he gets--anybody gets that tax cut in this audience? No. Nobody got that tax cut. Are you still waiting for it? No, you're not going to wait for it. Are you going to believe him next time he promises you a tax cut? No. They said he gave us the biggest tax hike in the history of America. He stopped it with the middle class. And 70 percent of the people affected by the tax increase were small-business men and small-business women from Ohio and...[missing text].

	But it did not end there...[missing text]...he said he opposed the federal gas tax. Missing text]...$32 billion gas tax hike, $32 billion, not for roads and highways, but if we go back into the general fund so he can figure out more ways to spend your money.

	And running for office the last time, he said, "We're not going to fool with Social Security." But as soon as he took office he raised taxes on Social Security benefits for between 4 and 6 billion seniors because he said they were rich, if they made $35,000 or $34,000 or more.

	Now, running for office the last time, he advocated an $800-per-child tax credit. He's making a similar promise this election. But not only has he never submitted the original proposal to Congress, he actually vetoed, as Steve knows, a child credit sent to him by the Republican Congress--vetoed it.

	He's a hard man to follow. But, when he promised us last time, he promised us quoting again a Clinton-Gore administration that would have buried small-businesspeople and entrepreneurs. Now, that's what he said. But once in office his tax increases were felt especially in the area of small business, forcing some into a higher tax bracket, than/with...[missing text]...four to five hundred companies. Their taxes were raised 30 to 40 percent--if you had a sub-chapter-S corporation--your taxes. And according to one survey most small businesses in America had to raise prices, they had to vote...[missing text]...for an expansion or fire just one employee just to make ends meet, thanks to President Bill Clinton, who promised you one thing and gave you another.

	He also...[missing text]...for cutting wasteful government spending. But once---but once...[missing text]...that's a tough one to follow. But once in office he proposed the most fancy spending...[missing text]...in the...[missing text]...history, including federal dollars for projects like a shopping center in Indiana, a casino in Connecticut, he had said they haven't any casinos, and carousel renovations in Rhode Island. That's what he did.

	What else did he promise? He would present a five-year plan to balance the budget. You've seen that ad--ten years, eight years, nine years, seven years, six years, five years--these were all these were all...[missing text]...We're still waiting. We're still waiting. He said he...[missing text]...vetoed a balanced budget, making him the only president in history who vetoed a federal budget because he wanted more spending, the only president in history. And he twisted arms all over Washington to defeat our efforts to add a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution--six Democrats who had voted for it, who said they were for it, voted no after he twisted their arms in the White House, and we lost the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution by one vote in the U.S. Senate.

	And of course we all know what he said about welfare. He was going to end it ...[missing text]. He didn't do a thing for three and a half years. He vetoed it twice. We sent it to him the third time. He finally signed it but then he said he was going to undo it next year. Now, that's what I call commitment. He was already hinting he was going to undo it after this election, and Vice President Gore's out there saying the same thing.

	But I just want to say if you're listening to these debates, ask yourself this question. Would you buy a used election promise from this man?

	Because this string of broken promises carries with it a real cost for every American family in higher taxes and stagnant family incomes and lower wages and more bankruptcies...[missing text]. He's proposed 484 new spending initiatives...[missing text]...going into office. And had they all passed, they would have cost, not $2 billion, but $2 trillion dollars. And had Republicans not said no in Congress,...[missing text]... would have cost the average American family about $4,000 a year for every year that Bill Clinton was in the White House--$4,000 more in higher taxes, lower growth and a smaller family income. Now...[missing text]...flexible for those who ...[missing text]... he stubbornly tried to launch a government takeover of the finest health care system in the world. Don't forget what he tried to do, because he'll try it again--they've already indicated he'll try it again. Fifty new bureaucracies, seventeen new taxes, a trillion and a half dollars...[missing text]. He had persistently supported trial lawyers in their frivolous lawsuits, while proposing reform of our legal system. He has campaigned for the national teachers' union leaders and opposed giving parents more control over their children's education. What did he say?

	He makes promises that are liberal, and promises that are conservative, but the only promises he keeps are his liberal promises, because he is a liberal.

	He is a liberal. And I said this was a consumer guide--now here, for all the debate watchers, a sort of report on Bill Clinton--buyer, beware. What you see is not what you get. Number one: the real cost is way over the list price.

	Number two: high and dangerous...[missing text]...costs will shoot up unexpectedly. This...[missing text]...is uncontrolled for the length...[missing text]...except for the things in...[missing text]...upcoming elections when he rolls to the right...[missing text]. This is Bill Clinton.

	That's why, on November 5th, the American people are going to demand a factory recall of Bill Clinton and his liberal politics. And they're going to send me and Jack Kemp to take over, and we're going to take over.

	We believe we're on the threshold of a breathtaking future, if we will trust the American people. And let me just talk about two minutes more.

	Our plan is a 15 percent across-the-board tax cut, a $500-per-child tax credit, for children under eighteen. We're going to cut the capital gains rate in half and create more jobs and more opportunities than any...[missing text]...We're going to eliminate...[missing text]...a capital gains tax for virtually all Americans who are older...[missing text]. You sell your house and you don't pay any capital...[missing text]. And we're going to go in and repeal...[missing text]. Bill Clinton's tax hike on senior citizens.

	And if you work all your life, your father and mother and the whole family works all their life and somebody passes on, you shouldn't have to sell half the property to pay the estate tax. We're going to provide estate tax relief...[missing text]...you can save more of your money tax free.

	And we're going to have what we have termed as "opportunity scholarships", for parents to choose better schools for their children, particularly low income families and low middle-income parents. They're terribly pleased with him...[missing text]...because he's a great governor and...[missing text]...in giving scholarships to low income families, so that they can attend the school that's best for them--public, private or religious.

	Nobody's child should have to go to a bad school in America, nobody's child. Every family should have the same right as the president of the United States who sends his child to the school of his choice. And I don't quarrel...[missing text]...you for that, but Mr. President, give low income families or low-middle income families the same choice.

	Let's all think of one simple principle: It's your money. It's not my money. It's not his money. It's your money. And you shouldn't have to apologize for wanting to keep more of what you earned. The government should apologize for taking too much of it in the first place. That's...[missing text].

	And I hope everybody here...[missing text]...pointed out here. It says exactly what this tax credit means for you and your family. And if you haven't...[missing text]...get one on the way out. It's the same chart that's right behind me. Just look across here.

	Let's say you make $30,000 and you have three children. You're not going to pay taxes at all. You get a 100 percent tax cut. If you have two children and make $30,000 you're going to get an 86 percent tax cut. That's what this is all about. It's for families with children, for families. We want to help American families. If you have two children, you're going to save a lot...[missing text]...look at the tax--one child--if you have no children, you get a little less but you still get the 15 percent cut. So...[missing text]...this is important. And I...[missing text]...long enough. I...[missing text]...Bill Clinton made all those promises and then raised your taxes ...[missing text]. Well, let me tell you that I keep my word...[missing text].

	And I know that some of these tax cuts don't sound like a lot of money to people, but these are Main Street; these are not Wall Street numbers. Families with children can use the extra money. Families with children with $30,000 and one child--they'll see $827. That's a couple of--three or four months' day care, a couple of mortgage payments, a down payment, whatever. Maybe you can take a vacation. Why shouldn't you take a vacation, instead of ...[missing text].

	So I hope every newspaper in America and every TV station will print this and broadcast this chart. There it is. It doesn't take a rocket scientist, as Gary Becker, the Nobel Prize winner from ...[missing text]...University, said--this is Economics 101. This is easy. It's giving more resources to families than ...[missing text]. So by giving more resources to business to create more jobs and opportunities and give less to the ringdingers and...[missing text]...business in the first place. We're not trusting the American people to know best how to spend their own hard-earned money, rather than target them with one ...[missing text]...string attached government program that never really materializes.

	And most important it's about keeping faith with the people in this audience, the people all across the nation, and saying what you mean and then delivering on that promise, not saying one thing to get elected and then doing something totally different. I don't do those things. I spent a lifetime keeping my word.

	That's what this campaign is all about. I know that, in politics, people's trust is the most important thing there is...[missing text]...Congress I said that four Nobel Prize winners had signed off for this. They're not involved in politics. They think it's a good plan--increase growth, increase opportunities. It gives people a chance, opportunities they haven't had for a long time.

	Now Bill Clinton says he's ...[missing text], just what you'd expect from a good old liberal. That's his problem. He's too liberal. You're too liberal, Mr. President. Give the money back to the people. [missing text].... What does it say? It says ...[missing text]...federal Constitution gives the power of the federal government ...[missing text]...to the states. It belongs to the states and to the people. And you are the people. And you are the people.

	This has been around over 200 years. Our Founding Fathers were concerned about this concentration of power of the federal government. This is Article Ten of the Bill of Rights. It's not out of the Republican National Committee handbook. It's in the Constitution. It's time we start implementing this debate, to give power back to the states, that we did with welfare, Republican...[missing text]...as we'll do with Medicaid, as we did with ...[missing text]. We're going to do the job training program, send the money back to Governor...[missing text]...and the legislature and let them decide how it's going to be spent.

	[Missing text]. This is my pledge and this is my promise. I'm going to do ...[missing text]...American ...[missing text]...American workers, and people who have been left out by this administration. And oh, he'll talk about the economy, he won't tell you it's the worst growth in a century, that bankruptcy meets record highs, that interest...[missing text]...credit card...[missing text]...has gone way up. There are dozens of reasons why we need economic growth. And that's the reason we need a tax cut. President Kennedy understood it. Ronald Reagan understood it, and Bob Dole understands it and we're going to get it done.

	Let me ask Bill and Peggy ...[missing text]...to come up here. Bill's an old friend of mine--and all the other Republican candidates. I know there are a number of you that Governor...[missing text]...talked about...[missing text]...the County Commissioner--Bob Gardner's out there,...[missing text]...[missing text]...Come on up...[missing text]. I want you to see these outstanding candidates we have in the Republican Party. Look at the great record of Governor...[missing text]. Hasn't he done a great job?

	Let me just say finally, there's a little book out called Trusting the People. It's all, it's all about our economic plan. It's all about trusting you. Now, if we only trusted the government, we wouldn't have this ...[missing text]...trusting the government--that'll be Bill Clinton's ...[missing text]...trusting the government. Ours is trusting the people.

	It explains in detail because our plan is not just a tax cut. It's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It's a balanced budget amendment, a balanced budget by the year 2002. It's regulatory reform that costs the average family about $7,000 a year. It's ending all these frivolous lawsuits and putting a cap on punitive damages--if you know how the trial lawyers are. When I fell off that stage out in California the first call I got was from a trial lawyer. He said, "I think we've got a case here." I said, "Oh, ...[missing text]...case."...[missing text]. So--it's also about...[missing text]...on-the-job-training ...[missing text]...money back to the states like Ohio, for Governor...[missing text]...to do a great job of all the legislature ...[missing text]...right ...[missing text].

	This is about the future of America. It's about you. It's about your business. It's about your family. It's about your children. It's about your grandchildren. And together we're going to do it. 

	Thank you very much. God bless America.

That's who John McCain is fighting for. But we can't afford four more years like the last eight. George Bush and John McCain are out of ideas, they are out of touch, and if you stand with me in 17 days they will be out of time.   \n",

You already heard Governor Cuomo say of all the choices you have in Michigan, only one has ever balanced a government budget, only one has ever taken on lobbyists and resisted the influence of special interests. Only one has never been a part of the Washington special interest crowd. And only one made a real good choice for vice president, Al Gore of Tennessee.   \n",

We have one candidate in this election who is an outright racist, and appeals on racial prejudice, and he is no friend of labor.  Any laboring man who can find a way to support the former governor of Alabama has little or no regard for the union movement.



	Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very, very much.  Thank you.  I am not going to do that.  I am just going to tell him the truth and it is going to sound like I am giving them hell, that is all. 

	Ladies and gentlemen, my friends here, workers in this great Westinghouse East Pittsburgh works, and fellow citizens and fellow Democrats, it is a great morning, it is a great morning.  Yesterday you had the Republican nominee here.  Since then, the air has cleared up.  

	Any moment now, the sun is going to break out and shine, at least I know that the sun is going to be shining on the Democratic ticket on November 5th as you cast the vote for Humphrey and Muskie. 

	Let me just take a moment to say to Joe Gaydos how much that we support him and how much we ask all of you to support this man in his effort to represent the 20th Congressional District in the House of Representatives.  Joe Gaydos. 

	We have here a gentleman that you know very well, that has served you faithfully in the United States Senate, and I want you to be sure that you give your help and your support to someone that can work with me, and that is your Senator Joe Clark.  

	And what a joy it is to have a man that is a trusted, able and effective worker in the cause of liberal democracy helping us all across this state.  In fact, I have asked him to go into other states to help me because he is a fighter and he is a worker--and that is Johnny Dent--and, Johnny, I want to thank you.  

	Now, to Mayor Barr, my good friend, the mayor of Pittsburgh, and to Len Stacey, I am honored by your friendship, your support.  And I am very honored to have here as my number one top worker, Pete Flaherty, that has done such a good job for us all the way.  

	I. W. Abel is here with us today, my friend of the steel workers, of all of them here, and there are others.  And I want to talk to you about a few things that had been happening the last few days.  I got a few questions I want to ask , and I want to ask them of you as well as to ask them of my Republican opposition.  We are coming down now to the final days of this campaign and I believe there are some--they are the voters, thank you, thank you boys--I know it is a little bit inconvenient for you, but those are my friends back there, they are all Democrats, they are going to vote for us.  

	I have some questions I want to ask.  I want to ask some questions of Mr. Nixon who refuses to answer these questions in public debate.  I have been listening to this man.  I read this morning again, and I heard on the radio that he is cool.  Well let me tell you, he is going to be cold on November 5th.  

	I read this morning and heard on the television and the radio that he is still maintaining his same kind of campaign.  I hope he does, because it is a loser.  I hope he does.  

	You know this man has taken such an attitude about the election that he has been acting like he has been president now for about five months.  And I want you to know that by November 5th people are going to be so tired of him that they are going to think it is time for a change, and they are going to vote the Democratic ticket of Humphrey and Muskie.

	Ladies and gentlemen, the first decision that a candidate for the president makes--the very first one and the most important one--is his running mate, and I ask this great audience today to think about that.  I ask you to do so because we live in very perilous times--you know it and I know it.  We live in times of uncertainty, we live in a period, I regret to tell you, when you need in public office, particularly at the presidency and the vice presidency, men of integrity and ability.  In the last fifty years, we have had one out of every three of our presidents that has been unable to fulfill his full term of office, due to either natural death or violence or assassination.  It isn't nice to say, I don't like to say it, but let me tell you as the young people say, we have got to tell it like it is, and that is the way it is, and that is why that man that is on that ticket as your running mate is as important as the man that is at the head of the ticket, and when I made my choice, I didn't think just about myself.  I thought that if I were privileged to be elected president of this country, I wanted to have somebody to stand along side of me that could be helpful to me, to be sure, that could help bear the burden of the office, to be sure.  But I wanted to be sure of one other thing. I wanted to be sure that whatever fate may decreed, that if it should be that the man that stood alongside of me should become president, that he would be the best man that we could find in this country, and I gave you that best man in Senator Ed Muskie.  

	I ask you to consider the alternatives.  I ask you to think of what Mr. Nixon did.  He made a marriage of convenience.  I ask him today, did you pick the best man, Mr. Nixon, that you could find?  

	VOICES:  No!

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  Did you protect the interests of this country?  
	
	VOICES:  No!

	Did you think about what the burdens of this office are and what the requirements are in national security and foreign policy?  

	VOICES:  No!

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  I don't want--I want you friends to answer that question in the quiet of your own conscience in the voting booth because we run as a team.  The office today is so great and so big, so many responsibilities, the office of the president, that we need alongside of that president someone who can share the burden, can fulfill the responsibilities and, ladies and gentlemen, I say that Mr. Nixon did not put his country first.  I say that he put his own--what he thought was his political well-being first, and I say to you that that is not good enough for this twentieth century, it is not good enough for these times, and you know it.  I gave you a good man.   

	Now, my friends, let's just take a look at what has been going on here.  Mr. Nixon, I want to ask you some questions, and I want to ask this audience some questions.  You have heard this slogan.  Nixon is the one.  They have had it around the country for months, and I know it has had effect, it has been a big advertising campaign.  The White House, ladies and gentlemen, is not for sale, and the man that is president of the United States should not necessarily be one that has the largest advertising budget.  What you need in the presidency today is someone that you can trust, and someone in whom you can place your confidence, and what you need in the vice presidency is exactly the same thing.  So I ask some questions, since they say that Nixon is the one.  

	Just the other day, Mr. Nixon, for the first time in two years, was on a national news show.  I have been on them dozens of times.  He was on what they call Face the Nation.  First time in two years that he openly met [missing text] and gentlemen, if you can't meet the reporters, how can you expect to have the trust of the voters?  But finally he got on.  And when he got on there, one of the first things that he said that he would do was to abolish the Job Corps, the Job Corps for our kids that are dropouts, that never had a chance, that have been standing on street corners getting in trouble, and that Job Corps has trained 135,000 young men to be productive workers, and Mr. Nixon said no, he wasn't going to have any more of that.  And as he was saying it, a young man from Brooklyn, George Foreman, was in Mexico City having received the highest honors, the gold medal as the United States athlete in the heavyweight division--winning honors for himself, for his race, for his family, for his country--being honored internationally--and as George Foreman was being honored, he said that he got his chance because he got a break in the Job Corps, and Mr. Nixon, within the minute at the same time that this was going on, announced that when he is president he will abolish the Job Corps.

	Ladies and gentlemen, that shows you the kind of insight that the Republican nominee has into human need.  Here is a man that brought your country honor.  Here is a man that raised himself out of the slums.  Here is a man, if you please, that got a chance for the first time in his life and he brings fame to our country and, Mr. Nixon says the Job Corps will go.  Well, Mr. Nixon, I got news for you.  You are the one that is going to go.  

	So let me ask this question: who is it that announced Sunday he wants to abolish the Job Corps?  

	VOICES:  Nixon!

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  Nixon is the one, you bet you.  Who called the Peace Corps, one of our greatest programs, a "haven for draft dodgers"?  

	VOICES:  Nixon!

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  Nixon, yes, you bet: Nixon is the one.  Who fought all of his life against Medicare?  

	VOICES:  Nixon!

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  What is that?

	VOICES:  Nixon!

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  And now, says that it ought to be improved.  I will tell you, Nixon is the one.

	Let me tell you, my dear friends, when a man has spent twenty years in opposition to a program and suddenly decides just before the election that he is for it, watch out.  Watch out.  Remember those words of scripture, "Ye shall judge them by their deeds, not by their words."  And Mr. Nixon, your deed on Job Corps was to never let it happen.  He said it wouldn't work.  He said it was the wrong thing.  He said he was opposed to it, and any elderly person in Pittsburgh or Pennsylvania that will trust Richard Nixon with Medicare is gong to have a life of illness, I can tell you that. 

	Who was it that opposed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and called it a "cruel hoax", "catastrophic nonsense", but Saturday night said he thought it was a good thing.  You know...

	VOICES:  Nixon!

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  You know that fellow has the best debate going on between himself.  The old Nixon and the new Nixon, they are mixing it up--and we are really finding out the real Nixon.  And who was it that stalled the recent treaty to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, a treaty that is vital to the defense of this country, and a treaty that is vital to the peace of the world?  Who was it that put the dagger in the back of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty?  

	VOICES:  Nixon!

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  Let's get it now.  Nixon is the one.

	VOICES:  And who broke a tie vote in the Senate and voted "no", voted "no" on federal aid to education for our kids?  What's his name?  

	VOICES:  Nixon!

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  And who joined his Republican friends for years in killing federal help for schools and killed it on the basis of race or religion?  What's his name?  

	VOICES:  Nixon! 

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  And who had the unmitigated gall to come to this city yesterday and say that he was for schools and killed it on the basis of race or religion?  What's his name?  

	VOICES:  Nixon! 

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you something.  Take a look at Joe Clark, who helped get aid to these schools.  Take a look at the man that is talking to you.  I am one of the authors of the National Defense Education Act.  I fought for all of my public career for federal aid to students, higher education, elementary education, secondary education, private, parochial, public, and Richard Nixon never cast a vote in his life for it, and he comes around here--and he comes here knowing that there are people in this city of religious conviction that are concerned about their schools, and he pretends he is your friend.

	Ladies and gentlemen, he has never cast one vote in his life for any aid to education, public or private or parochial, and I am not going to let him get by with it in Pittsburgh.  It is outright hypocrisy, and he knows it.  

	Now, ladies and gentlemen, who has had a totally consistent anti-labor record all of his life?  

	VOICES:  Nixon! 

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  You bet he has, and he comes around here telling this Westinghouse plant that he will protect you from foreign imports.  Well, who is it who has never given you a vote to help you in your goods?  

	VOICES:  Nixon! 

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  I want to tell you this fellow has become the number one double-talker of all times, the new Nixon and the old Nixon in debate, revealing the real Nixon, and that is the fellow you can't afford to have president of the United States. 

	By the way, who was it that made Strom Thurmond, Mr. Dixiecrat himself, his southern campaign manager, and who was it that sent private valentines to Wall Street brokers promising them special treatment at the expense of the ordinary shareholder?  You know, Nixon is the one.  

	VOICES:  Nixon!

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  So, my friends, there is a whole list of it.  This is a man who says your taxes are higher than ever, and what is it?  Three times the Democratic administration reduced taxes, and today...

	VOICES:  Boo!  Boo!

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:...today the federal tax, the federal tax rate is an average of 14 percent lower than it was the last year of the Republican administration.  That is what Mr. Nixon knows to be true.  But Mr. Nixon likes to come around and say he will do it better.  Ladies and gentlemen, it is the same old Richard.  He hasn't changed.  It is the same old Republican Party.  I was here when this plant didn't have this much employment.  I was in Pittsburgh in those years of the 1950s.  I was here when you had that Republican stop-and-go recession, a little prosperity, what I called the hiccup economy--you pause a moment and then you hic, and then you up a little--and then you pause.  That kind of economics, ladies and gentlemen, helps no one.

	So, my friends, I have got a question to ask you: what has the Republican Mr. Nixon ever done for you?  

	VOICES:  Nothing!

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  What has he ever done for schools and young people?  

	VOICES:  Nothing! 

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY: Mr. Worker, what has he ever done for your family on wages and jobs?  

	VOICES:  Nothing! 

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  Mr. Union Man, what has he ever done for your union?  

	VOICES:  Nothing! 

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  And to the elderly people, did he ever give you a vote for Medicare? 
	
	VOICES:  No!

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  What has he done for you?  

	VOICES:  Nothing! 

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  Well, may I ask you, what are you going to do for him?  

	VOICES:  Nothing!

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  That is a fair deal. 

	Now, there is another candidate running, and I have heard that he might have a vote or two around here.

	Let's talk about it.  This candidacy of Mr. George Wallace--I am not talking about James Wallace up here.  He is a good man, and I know, I don't want to be confused.  I believe he is up in Room 11N if I am not mistaken, and he is all right.  Let's get our Wallaces straight.  I am talking about George from Alabama, not James from East Pittsburgh.  I am not talking about him.  I am talking about George Wallace, the man that says he is for law and order, who says, "If you lie down in front of my car, I will run over you."  Who says, "I will obey the court orders I like, and the ones I don't, I won't."  Who puts his arms up says to a little child, "You can't enter this school."  A man who obeys the laws he likes, and disobeys the ones he doesn't.  You try it some time and see where you end up, and see what happens to you.

	We don't need that kind of law and order.  A man whose state has the highest murder rate in the nation, a man whose state has the highest--second highest aggravated assault rate in the nation.  We don't want that kind of law and order.  They didn't want it in Alabama, and we don't need it in Washington, and we sure don't need it in Pittsburgh.

	The way you get law and order, my friends, is to back your police.  The way to get it is to professionalize them.  The way you get it is to train them.  And the way you get it is to have some social justice, none of which Mr. Wallace seems to be willing to comment on.  But the biggest fraud of it all is the economics of it.  Mr. Wallace parades as a friend of the working man.  Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you, if that is the case, then George is Santa Claus.  

	A friend of the working man.  Union busting, low wages, and may I say to every father here and every mother, the second lowest per capita investment in education of any state in the union; this man is no friend of the working man.  He represents the anger and the fear and the suspicion and the bitterness that is in our society today, and we can't afford to elect that, and I ask every friend here of this city, every friend of this country of ours, to reject those voices of bitterness and hate.  We Americans are going to have to learn to live together.  We have to stand alone together sometime.  We are going to need each other, black or white, whatever may be our race, creed or religion.  

	Ladies and gentlemen, when a black man gets a job, he doesn't take yours.  It merely means that somebody got a chance.  When 10 million new Americans got jobs, it didn't take yours.  It meant that somebody else got a chance.  When 12 million people came up out of poverty, as they have this last eight years, it didn't hurt you.  It helped you, because as America grows, as our economy expands, as our jobs increase, we are all better.  America is better.  The only person that is going to take your job is a Republican presidential administration.  That is the last time you lost your job. 

	Well now, friends, we are in the season of Halloween.  For several weeks you have had Nixon tricks.  Now the time comes for Humphrey and Muskie treats.  

	And we are going to give you that chance because the question is: whom can you trust to govern this country, who can work together with our people?  

	VOICES:  Humphrey!  Humphrey!

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  Who can bring labor and management to work together?  

	VOICES:  Humphrey!  Humphrey!

	And who can protect the security of this land without engaging in a costly dangerous arms race?  

	VOICES:  Humphrey!  Humphrey!

	VICE PRESIDENT HUMPHREY:  Yes, my friends, I hope that that is your message.  I ask you to do one other thing: protect your job, protect your home, protect your country and look at the record.  Judge us by our deeds, judge us by what we have performed, judge us, if your please, by the thirty-five years of social progress in this country that started in the depths of the depression and today and opportunities for business, for labor, for our youngsters, and then think about that tomorrow, a world that is in danger and a society that needs to be knitted together as one family.

	I want to be your president to help make America a better place.  I want to be your president to help people learn how to work together and live together.  I want to be your president to help safeguard this country, and to help remove the dangers that are in this world.  I need your help.  We are going to win this election, friends.  Two weeks ago they said we couldn't.  Now we can make it.  

	Let's go out and win the election on November 5th.
